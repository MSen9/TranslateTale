* Hmmm...
* You're new to the 698   UNDERGROUND 612 , aren'tcha?
* Golly 611 , you must be 698   so confused.
* Someone ought to teach 698   you how things work 698   around here!
* I guess little old me 698   will have to do.
* Ready 612 ? 698 * Here we go!
 602 * This way.

 602 * Welcome to your new 698   home 611 , innocent one.
* Allow me to educate you 698   in the operation of the 698   RUINS.
 602 * The RUINS are full of 698   puzzles.
* Ancient fusions between  698   diversions and doorkeys.
* One must solve them 698   to move from room to 698   room.
* Please adjust yourself    to the sight of them.
 602 * To make progress here, 611   698   you will need to trigger 698   several switches.
* Do not worry, 611  I have  698   labelled the ones that 698   you need to flip.
* Do not worry, 611  I have  698   labelled the ones that 698   you need to flip.
* ... eh 611 ? 698 * It seems that the 698   labelling has worn away.
* Oh dear.
* This might be far more 698   challenging than I 698   anticipated...
 602 * The first switch is over 698   on the wall.
 601 * Do you need some help.. 611 ? 698 * Press the switch on the   wall.
 600 * Come on 611 , you can do it!
 602 * Go on 611 , press the switch 698   on the left.
 602 * I believe it was 698   the switch on the 698   left.
 601 * You do know which way 698   left is 611 , do you not?
 600 * Press the switch that I 698   labelled for you.
 601 * You do know which way 698   left is 611 , do you not?
 601 * You are very curious, 611   698   are you not?
 601 * Please understand. 612   698   600 I only want the best 698   for you.
 600 * Splendid! 612   698 * I am proud of you, 611   698   little one.
* Let us move to the 698   next room.
 601 * As a human living in 698   the UNDERGROUND, 611   698   monsters may attack you.
 602 * You will need to be 698   prepared for this 698   situation.
 600 * However, worry not! 612   698 * The process is simple.
 602 * When you encounter a  698   monster, 611  you will enter 698   a FIGHT.
* While you are in a 698   FIGHT 611 , strike up a 698   friendly conversation.
 602 * Stall for time. 698   I will come to resolve 698   the conflict.
 602 * Practice talking to 698   the dummy.
 601 * Ahh, 611  the dummies are 698   not for fighting! 612   698 * They are for talking!
* We do not want to hurt 698   anybody, do we...? 612   600   698 * Come now.
 600 * Ah, 611  very good! 612   698 * You are very good.
 601 * ...
 601 * ... you ran away...
 600 * Truthfully 611 , that was 698   not a poor choice.
 600 * It is better to 698   avoid conflict 698   whenever possible.
 601 * That.. 611 . however 611 , is 698   only a dummy 612 . 698 * It cannot harm you.
 601 * It is made of cotton 611 . 698 * It has no desire 698   for revenge...
 600 * Nevermind 612 . 698 * Stay close to me and 698   I will keep you safe.
 603 *  611 . 611 . 611 .
 604 *  611 . 611 . 611 .
 600 * The next room awaits.
 602 * Practice talking to 698   the dummy.
 601 * You can say anything.. 612 . 602   698 * I do not think the dummy 698   will be bothered.
 600 * Do you need some 698   ideas for conversation 698   topics?
* Well 611 , I often start with 698   a simple 'how do you 698   do...'
* You could ask them about 698   their favorite books...
* Jokes can be useful for 698   'breaking the ice.'
* Listen to this one...
* What did the skeleton 698   tile his roof with?
* ... SHIN-gles!
 601 * ...
 600 * Well 611 , I thought it 698   was amusing.
 602 * Practice talking to 698   the dummy.
 601 * You can say anything.. 612 . 600   698 * The dummy will not 698   be bothered.
 601 * There is another puzzle 698   in this room...
 600 * I wonder if you can 698   solve it?
 601 * This is the puzzle 611 , 698   but...
 600 * Here 611 , take my hand 698   for a moment.
 601 * Puzzles seem a little 698   too dangerous for 698   now.
...
 602 * Greetings, 611  my child 612 . 698 * Do not worry 611 , I did 698   not leave you.
 600 * I was merely behind this 698   pillar the whole time.
* Thank you for trusting 698   me.
 602 * However 611 , there was an 698   important reason for 698   this exercise.
* ... to test your 698   independence.
 601 * I must attend to some 698   business 611 , and you must 698   stay alone for a while.
 600 * Please remain here 612 . 698 * 601  It's dangerous to 698   explore by yourself.
 600 * I have an idea 612 . 698 * I will give you a 698   CELL PHONE.
* If you have a need for 698   anything 611 , just call.
 601 * Be good 611 , alright?
 600 * You have done 698   excellently thus 698   far 611 , my child.
 602 * However... I have a 698   difficult request to ask 698   of you.
* ...
* I would like you to walk 698   to the end of the room 698   by yourself.
 601 * Forgive me for this.
* Ring.. 600 . 625  
 641  
* Hello? 698 * This is TORIEL.
* For no reason in 698   particular... 698 * Which do you prefer?
* Cinnamon or 698   butterscotch? 698   Cinnamon    Bscotch 
 
* Oh 611 , I see. 698 * Thank you very much!
 628   640   630  
* Click...
* 
* It's a fishing rod affixed 698   to the ground...
* Reel it in? 698   698          Yes         No

SO LET'S LET 698 BYBONES BE 698 BYBONES.
I'LL EVEN TELL YOU 698 HOW TO LEAVE THE 698 UNDERGROUND!
JUST KEEP GOING 698 EAST!
EVENTUALLY YOU'LL 698 REACH THE KING'S 698 CASTLE.
THEN YOU CAN 698 LEAVE!
REALLY! 611 ? 698 YOU WANT TO BE 698 FRIENDS 611 , WITH ME???
WELL THEN...
 600 I GUESS.. 611 .
I GUESS 698 I CAN MAKE AN 698 ALLOWANCE FOR YOU!
 
HUH 611 ? 698 WHY WOULD YOU...
BERATE YOURSELF 698 SO LOUDLY???
IS IT BECAUSE...
 603 YOU DON'T THINK 698 YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH 698 TO BE MY FRIEND?

 652 * YEAH!! 611 ! 698 * I'M INTO IT!!!
* (You place the noodles 698   in one at a time.)
* (They clank against the 698   empty bottom.)

 600 * Humans suck 611 , but 698   their history.. 611 . 698 * Kinda rules.
 602 * Case in point 611 : 698 * This giant sword!
 600 * Historically 611 , humans 698   wielded swords up 698   to 10x their size.
 601 * RIGHT? 698   698   True        False
 
 606 * Heh 611 , I knew it!

 607 * I always was a crybaby 611 , 698   wasn't I 611 ,  620 ?
 601 * ...
 602 * ... I know.
 600 * You're not actually 698    620 , are you?
 607 *  620 's been gone for 698   a long time.
* ...
 609 * Um.. 611 . what...
 600 * What IS your name?
 602 * ...
 605 * "Frisk?"
 607 * That's...
 605 * A nice name.
* ...
 607 * Frisk...
 600 * I haven't felt like 698   this for a long time.
 602 * As a flower 611 , I was 698   soulless.
 601 * I lacked the power to 698   love other people.
 602 * However 611 , with everyone's 698   souls inside me...
 607 * I not only have my own 698   compassion back...
 605 * But I can feel every 698   other monster's as 698   well.
 607 * They all care about 698   each other so much.
 600 * And.. 611 . they care about 698   you too 611 , Frisk.
* ...
 607 * I wish I could tell 698   you how everyone 698   feels about you.
* Papyrus.. 611 . Sans.. 611 . 698 * Undyne.. 611 . Alphys...
 600 * ... Toriel.
 607 * Monsters are weird.
 605 * Even though they barely 698   know you...
 606 * It feels like they 698   all really love 698   you.
 608 * Haha.
* ...
 601 * Frisk.. 611 . I.. 611 . 698 * I understand if you 698   can't forgive me.
* I understand if you 698   hate me.
* I acted so strange and 698   horrible.
 603 * I hurt you.
* I hurt so many people.
 601 * Friends 611 , family 611 , 698   bystanders...
 603 * There's no excuse for 698   what I've done.
  698   698   Forgive     Do not
 
 603 * Wh.. 611 . what?
 607 * ... Frisk 611 , come on.
 600 * You're.. 611 . 698 * You're gonna make me 698   cry again.
 607 * ... besides 611 , even if 698   you do forgive me...
 602 * ... right 611 .
* I understand.
 601 * I just hope that...
* I can make up for 698   it a little right 698   now.
 601 * I can't keep these 698   souls inside of me.
 600 * The least I can do 698   is return them.
 602 * But first...
 604 * There's something I 698   have to do.
* Right now 611 , I can feel 698   everyone's hearts 698   beating as one.
* They're all burning 698   with the same 698   desire.
* With everyone's power.. 611 . 698 * With everyone's 698   determination...
* It's time for 698   monsters...
* To finally go free.
 607 * Frisk...
 600 * I have to go now.
 607 * Without the power of 698   everyone's souls...
 601 * I can't keep 698   maintaining this 698   form.
* In a little while...
* I'll turn back into 698   a flower.
 603 * I'll stop being 698   "myself."
* I'll stop being able 698   to feel love again.
 601 * So.. 611 . Frisk.
 607 * It's best if you 698   just forget about 698   me 611 , OK?
 600 * Just go be with 698   the people who 698   love you.
 628   640   630  
  698          Comfort 698          him         Do not
 
 600 * So 611 , Alphys...
 609 * What do you want 698   to do now that 698   we're all free?
 600 * We have the whole 698   world to explore 698   now.
 603 * W-well 611 , of course 698   I'm going to go 698   out and...
 604 * Um...
 603 * No 611 , I should be 698   honest!!
 601 * I'm gonna stay inside 698   and watch anime like 698   a total loser!
 600 THAT'S THE SPIRIT!
EVERYONE!! 611 ! 698 A CELEBRATION!!! 698 TO BEING LOSERS!!
 609 * Heh 611 . 698 * Papyrus has the 698   right idea.
 600 * Losing to Frisk is 698   the best thing to 698   ever happen to me.
 600 * So I'm glad that 698   we...
 609 * Huh 611 ? 698 * What is it 611 , Asgore?
 602 * Um.. 611 . what's an...
 600 * ... anime?
 601 * (Oh My God?)
 603 * (Frisk 611 . Please.)
 602 * (Help me explain what 698   anime is to Asgore.)
 600 * Y-you see 611 , it's 698   like a cartoon 611 , 698   but...
 628   640   630  
  698          With        With 698          Sword's     Gun's
 
 602 * So it's like a 698   cartoon.. 611 . 698 * But with swords?
 602 * So it's like a 698   cartoon.. 611 . 698 * But with guns?
 600 * Golly 611 ! 698 * That sounds neato!
 603 * Where is this 611 ? 698 * Where can I see the 698   Anime.
 603 * H-hold on 611 , uh.. 611 . 698 * I think I have 698   some on my phone.
 600 * Here 611 , l-look at 698   this!
 600 * ...
 603 *...Oh 611 , uh...
 604 * Um.. 611 . that's the.. 611 . 698 * That's the wrong...
 605 * Uh 611 , nevermind.

 609 * ... kissing?
 600 * Boy 611 ! 698 * Technology sure is 698   something 611 , isn't it?
 605 * Eheheh.. 611 . yeah 611 ! 698 * It sure is!
 600 * Psst.. 611 . 698 * F-Frisk.
 603 * Um 611 , you've gotta 698   tell me.
 606 * D.. 611 . do you think 698   Asgore and Toriel 698   are...?
 603 * Uh 611 , ever gonna get 698   back together?
 628   640   630  
 698   698          Yeah        Nope
 
* Error...
 607 * Y-yeah!! 611 ! 698 * Yeah 611 , that's what 698   I hope 611 , too.
 607 * Just think about how 698   cute they must have 698   been together.
 600 * It's quickly becoming 698   my number one ship 698   of all time.
 607 * Tori and Gorey...
 605 * My.. 611 . 698 * My old boss and 698   his ex-wife.
 608 * ... uh 611 , that sounds 698   a lot less cool 698   all of a sudden.
 608 * ... yeah 611 , that's what 698   I thought.
 607 * A woman can dream 698   though 611 , right?
 602 * And write fanfiction.
 601 * A LOT of fanfiction.
 600 * Frisk 611 ! 698 * I just realized!
 603 * Now that we aren't 698   fighting each 698   other...
 602 * I can finally ask 698   you...
 600 * "Would you like a 698   cup of tea?"
 602 * ...
 600 * Would you like a 698   cup of tea?
 628   640   630  
 698   698          Yes         No
 
* Error...
* Oh 611 ! 698 * Well!
 603 * Actually 611 , the cup I 698   had is cold now.
* So you shouldn't 698   have it.
 600 * But 611 , I am so 698   happy you said 698   yes.
 600 * As soon as I can 611 , 698   I will make some 698   more for you.
 600 * Then we can be 698   great pals.
 603 * Oh...
 603 * Okay.
 602 * Frisk 611 ! Stop 611 ! 698 * You're breaking his 698   big burly heart!
 602 * Um 611 , it's OK 611 , Undyne.
 600 * My heart's already 698   broken.
 606 * ASGORE 611 ! STOP 611 ! 698 * YOU'RE BREAKING MY 698   BIG BURLY HEART!
 609 * Y-yeah 611 , Asgore 611 . 698 * Don't break Undyne's 698   heart.
 602 * That's my job.
 602 * OH MY GOD! 698 * YOU'RE GOING BACK 698   IN THE TRASH!!!
 600 CAN I GO IN THE 698 TRASH TOO?

* I want to be a better 698   person.
* I don't want to be 698   afraid anymore.
* And for that to happen 611 , 698   I have to be able to 698   face my own mistakes.
* I'm going to start 698   doing that now.
* I want to be clear.
* This isn't anyone else's 698   problem but mine.

 Hey! 611 ! 698  There you are!!
 642  I 611 , uh 611 , realized 611 , 698  if you deliver that 698   thing...
 643  It might be a bad 698  idea.
 644  So I'm gonna do 698  it!! 611 ! 698  Give it to me!!!
 643  Huh! 611 ? 698  You don't have it!?
 644  Ngggaaahhh!!
 Have you at least 698  seen her!?*
                               698    Yeah            Nope      698                             
 Yes?
 646  So she's somewhere 698  around here...
 640  Thanks 611 . 698  I'll keep looking.
 No???
 But she wasn't 698  at home...
 643  Where the heck 698  could she be!?
 602 Oh my god...
 606 W... well 611 , I guess 698 it's obvious 611 , huh?
 607 I... 611  uh.. 611 . 698 I really like her.
 609 I mean 611 , more than 698 I like other people!
 607 I'm sorry.
 606 I j-just figured 611 , 698 y-you know...
 607 It'd be f-fun to 698 go on like 611 , a cute 611 , 698 kind of...
 606 P 653 retend date with you 611 ? 698 T-to make you feel 698 better?
 607 ...
 606 Well 611 , it sounds even 698 worse when I put it 698 like that.
 608 I 650 'm sorry 611 . 698 I messed up again.
 607 Undyne's the person I.. 611 . 698 Um.. 611 . really want to 698 go on a date with.
But, I mean.. 611 . 698 She's way out of 698 my league.
 609 N-not that you 698 aren't 611 , um 611 , cool!
 607 B-but.. 611 . Undyne...
She's so confident.. 611 . 698 And strong.. 611 . 698 And funny...
 608 And I'm just a 698 nobody.
 653 A fraud.
I'm the royal 698 scientist 611 , but...
 650 All I've ever done 698 is hurt people.
 607 I've told her so 698 many lies 611 , she thinks 698 I'm...
 606 She thinks I'm a 698 lot cooler than I 698 actually am.
 607 If she gets close 698 to me 611 , she'll...
 608 She'll find out the 698 truth about me.
 607 ...
 607 What should I do?*
                               698    Tell her        Keep      698    the truth       lying    
 609 The truth...?
 654 But if I tell her 698 that 611 , she'll hate 698 me.
 606 I 650 sn't it better 698 this way?
To live a lie where 698 both people are 698 happy...
 607 Or a truth where 698 neither of us 698 are?
They say "be 698 yourself."
 608 But I don't 698 really like who 698 "myself" is.
 607 I'd rather just 698 be whatever makes 698 people like me.
 606 Eheheh...
 607 ...
 608 ...
No, you're right.
Every day I'm 698 scared...
 607 Scared what will 698 happen if people 698 learn the truth 698 on their own.
 653 They'll all get 698 hurt because of 698 me...
 609 B 654 ut how can I 698 tell UNDYNE the 698 tr.. 611 . truth?
 608 I d-don't have the 698 confidence...
 609 I'm going to mess 698 it up 611 ! 698 How can I 698 practice!?
Yeah.. 611 . yeah 611 , you're 698 right!
 606 I 650 've come this far 611 , 698 I c-can't tell 698 her now!
 607 Sh-she'd be really 698 hurt if she found 698 out 611 , right?
 605 S-so it'll just 698 be 611 , uh 611 , a little 698 secret!
 651 What people don't 698 know can't hurt 698 them!!
 650 Th-thank God I've 698 got an honest 698 friend like you!!

 603 I mean...
Undyne.. 611 . 698 I...
 644 I've been lying to 698 you!
 643 WHAT?? 611 ? 698 ABOUT WHAT???
About... well...
 602 Everything!
 607 I told you that 698 seaweed was like... 698 scientifically 698 important...
 645 Really, I just... 698 I just use it to 698 make ice cream 611 !
And those human 698 history books I 698 keep reading...
 647 Those are just 698 dorky comic books 611 !
And the history 698 movies.. 611 . 698 those.. 612 .
 642 Those are just 611 , uh 611 , 698 anime 612 ! 698 They aren't real 612 !
And that time I 698 told you I was 698 busy with work on 698 the phone.. 611 . I...
 649 Was just eating 698 frozen yogurt in 698 my pajamas!
 603 That time I...
Alphys.
 605 I.. 611 . I just wanted to 698 impress you!
I just wanted you 698 to think I was 698 smart and cool.
That I wasn't 698 some.. 611 . 698 nerdy loser.
Alphys.
 605 Undyne 611 , I.. 611 . 698 I really think you're 698 neat 611 , OK...
Alphys.
Shhhh.
Shhhhhh.
 640 Alphys!
I.. 611 . think you're 698 neat 611 , too, I guess.
 641 But, you've gotta 698 realize...
 642 Most of what you 698 said really doesn't 698 matter to me.
I don't care if 698 you're watching kid 698 cartoons or reading 698 history books.
 643 To me 611 , ALL of 698 that stuff is 698 just NERDY CRAP!
What I like about 698 you is that you're 698 PASSIONATE 611 ! 698 You're ANALYTICAL!!
It doesn't matter 698 what it is 611 ! 698 YOU CARE ABOUT IT!!
 644 100-PERCENT! 611 ! 698 AT MAXIMUM POWER!!!
 645 ... so 611 , you don't 698 have to lie to me.
 640 I don't want you 698 to have to lie to 698 anyone anymore.
 646 Alphys.. 611 . I want to 698 help you become 698 happy with who 698 you are!
 645 And I know just 698 the training you 698 need to do that!
Undyne.. 611 . 698 You...

 642 Pffft 611 , what 611 ? 698 ME?
 646 Nah 611 , I'm gonna 698 get Papyrus to 698 do it.
GET THOSE BONES 698 SHAKIN'!!!
IT'S TIME TO JOG 698 100 LAPS 611 , HOOTING 698 ABOUT HOW GREAT 698 WE ARE!!!
Ready 611 ? 698 I'm about to start 698 the timer!
 605   698   698     U-Undyne...
 601   698   698     I'll do my 698     best...!
 643 OH MY GOD!!!
 645 She was kidding 611 , 698 right!? 
Those cartoons.. 611 . 698 those comics...
 647 Those are still 698 REAL 611 , right!?
 648 ANIME'S REAL 611 , 698 RIGHT?!?!
   Anime is        Anime  698    Real            is not  698                    real
HA HA HA!!!
I KNEW IT!!!
GIGANTIC SWORDS!! 611 ! 698 MAGICAL PRINCESSES 611 ! 698 HERE I COME!!!

I CAN FEEL MY 698 HEART BREAKING 698 INTO PIECES!!!
 646 ...
Uhh 611 , thanks for 698 taking care of 698 Alphys.
 649 I didn't get to 698 say what I wanted 698 to 611 , but...
 640 Things seem like 698 they're going to get 698 better for her.
 646 Well 611 , I gotta go 698 catch up with 698 them!
Later!
 643 ...

* (I don't want to open it... 611 ) 698 * (C- 611 can't I just slide it 698   back out...?)
* (...)
* (N.. 611 . no.. 611 . I can't keep doing 698   this. 611 ) 698 * (I'll read this one.)
* (...)
* (Um... 611 ) 698 * (I-it's shut k-kind of 698   strongly 611 , isn't it?)
* (Wait a second...)
* Hey 611 , if this is a 698   joke 611 , it's...
 601 * ...
 603 * Oh My God?
 605 * Did YOU write this 698   letter?
 606 * It wasn't signed 611 , so 611 , 698   I had no idea who 698   could have...
 608 * Oh my god 611 . 698 * Oh no.
 607 * That's adorable...
 605 * And I h-had no idea 698   you 611 , um 611 , wrote that way!
 609 * It's surprising 611 , too.. 611 . 698 * After all the gross 698   stuff I did...
 608 * I don't really deserve 698   to be forgiven.
 604 * Much less 611 , um...
 605 * This?
 601 * And so passionately 611 , 698   too.
 602 * ...
 600 * You know what 611 , okay 611 ! 698 * I'll do it!
 605 * It's the least I can 698   do to make it up 698   to you!
 660 * 607  Y-yeah 611 ! 698 *  660 Let's  661 go on a date 660 !
 600 * On second thought 611 , 698   maybe I WON'T write 698   fanfic of real people.
 607 * I mean 611 , isn't real life 698   already the greatest 698   fanfiction of all?
 608 * ...
 603 * Uh 611 , don't tell 698   anyone I said that.
 601 * Cause I'm gonna 698   post it online!
 600 * I sure am excited 698   to finally use the 698   human internet.
 607 * I bet they have all 698   sorts of things Undyne 698   and I can watch!
 606 * Oh man!!!
* We're gonna be 698   able to watch 698   anime online!?
 607 * Of course 611 , Undyne!
 602 * What do you think 698   we've been fighting 698   for all along?
 602 * yeah 611 , what do you...
 601 * whoops.
 601 * Jinx 611 ! 698 * I knew you were 698   gonna make that joke!
 603 WAIT 611 , ALPHYS, I 698 DIDN'T KNOW YOU 698 KNEW SANS.
 605 * Well.. 611 . 698 * I...
 602 * doesn't everybody?
 600 * Who the hell is Sans?
 608 * ...
 600 * Who the HECK is Sans?
 601 * TORIEL!?!?!
 600 * Hey Frisk 611 , why 698   don't you go look 698   for Mettaton?
 608 * He was here for 698   a while 611 , too...
 600 * But he said he 698   had to go somewhere.
* Th-that last 698   question...
 604 * He wasn't s-supposed 698   to ask that one...
* (Yellow feet are tapping 698   just behind the door.)
* I.. 611 . I just need 698   a moment.
* ...
* S.. 611 . Sorry about 698   that!
 605 * L-let's k-keep 698   going!
* S-so you're about 698   to meet ASGORE 611 , 698   h-huh?
 606 * You must be.. 611 . 698 * Y-you must be...
 605 * Pr.. 611 . pretty 698   excited about all 698   that 611 , huh?
* You'll f-f-finally...
 607 * You'll finally get 698   to go home!
* W.. 611 . 698 * Wait!
* I mean 611 , um.. 611 . 698 * I...
 601 * I was just going 698   to.. 611 . 698 * ...um...
 602 * Say goodbye 611 , and...
* ...
 603 * ...
 604 * ...
* I can't take 698   this anymore.
* I...
 605 * I lied to you.
 607 * A human SOUL isn't 698   strong enough to 698   cross the barrier alone.
 606 * It takes at least 698   a human soul...
 605 * And a monster 698   soul.
 605 * ...
* If you want to 698   go home...
 605 * You'll have to 698   take his soul.
 607 * You'll have to 698   kill ASGORE.
* I'm sorry.
* Oh 611 . 698 * My god.
* I didn't expect you 698   to show up so 698   soon!
* I haven't showered 611 , I'm 698   barely dressed 611 , it's 698   all messy 611 , and...
* Ummm...
* H-h-hiya!
* I'm Dr. Alphys 611 . 698 * I'm ASGORE's royal 698   scientist!
 603 * B-b-but 611 , ahhhh 611 , 698   I'm not one of 698   the "bad guys"!
 600 * Actually 611 , since you 698   stepped out of the 698   RUINS 611 , I've 611 , um...
 607 * ... been "observing" 698   your journey through 698   my console.
 603 * Your fights.. 611 . 698 * Your friendships.. 611 . 698 * Everything!
 600 * I was originally 698   going to stop 698   you 611 , but...
 607 * Watching someone on 698   a screen really makes 698   you root for them.
 607 * Watching you 611 , I felt 698   like.. 611 . like I was 698   seeing an old friend.
 600 * S-so 611 , ahhh 611 , now I 698   want to help you!
 606 * Using my knowledge 611 , 698   I can easily guide 698   you through Hotland!
 600 * I know a way right 698   to ASGORE's castle 611 , 698   no problem!
 602 * ...
 607 * Well 611 , actually 611 , umm 611 , 698   there's just a 698   tiny issue.
 600 * A long time ago 611 , I 698   made a robot named 698   Mettaton.
* Originally 611 , I built 698   him to be an 698   entertainment robot.
 607 * Uh 611 , you know 611 , like 698   a robotic TV star 698   or something.
 600 * Anyway 611 , recently I 698   decided to make him 698   more useful.
 607 * You know 611 , just some 698   small practical 698   adjustments.
 600 * Like 611 , um...
 604 * Anti.. 611 . anti-human 698   combat features?
 606 * Of c-course 611 , when I 698   saw you coming 611 , I 698   immediately decided...
 603 * I have to remove 698   those features!
 604 * Unfortunately 611 , I may 698   have made a teensy 698   mistake while doing so.
* And 611 , um...
 605 * Now he's an unstoppable 698   killing machine with a 698   thirst for human blood?
* Ehehehehe...
 608 * Heh.
 600 * But 611 , ummm 611 , hopefully 698   we won't run into 698   him!
* ...?
* Did you hear 698   something?
* Oh no.
* OHHHH YES!

 600 Goodbye.
 601 Now, 698 now.
There's 698 no need 698 to 698 fight.
Why not 698 settle 698 this...
Over a 698 nice cup 698 of tea?
* ASGORE attacks!
 600 * Howdy 611 , Frisk.
 603 * Sorry about almost 698   trying to take 698   your SOUL.
 605 * I feel very bad 698   about it.
 600 * I hope we can 698   still be pals.
 600 * Hey 611 , don't worry 698   about it 611 , ASGORE.
 602 * I think everybody's 698   tried to kill Frisk 698   at least once.
 602 * Oh.. 611 . I see!
 600 * In that case 611 , I'm 698   not sorry 611 , Frisk.
 606 * ASGORE 611 ! 698 * That's not what I 698   meant!
 603 * Oh 611 , Frisk 611 , if you're 698   not busy...
 600 * On nice days 611 , you 698   should walk around and 698   have a good time.
 600 * That's important.
Ah...
...
So that 698 is how 698 it is.
...
 603 Why.. 611 . 698 You...
I remember the day 698 after my son 698 died.
The entire underground 698 was devoid of hope.
The future had once 698 again been taken 698 from us by the 698 humans.
In a fit of anger, 698 I declared war.
I said that I would 698 destroy any human 698 that came here.
I would use their 698 souls to become 698 godlike...
... and free us from 698 this terrible prison.
Then, I would destroy 698 humanity...
And let monsters rule 698 the surface, in peace.
Soon, the people's 698 hopes returned.
My wife, however, 698 became disgusted with 698 my actions.
She left this place, 698 never to be seen 698 again.
Truthfully...
I do not want power.
I do not want to 698 hurt anyone.
I just wanted everyone 698 to have hope...
But...
I cannot take this 698 any longer.
I just want to 698 see my wife.
I just want to 698 see my child.
Please.. 611 . 698 Young one...
This war has gone 698 on long enough.
You have the power...
Take my soul, and 698 leave this cursed 698 place.
...
 600 After everything I 698 have done to 698 hurt you...
 607 You would rather 698 stay down here 698 and suffer...
 609 Than live happily 698 on the surface?
 606 ...
 601 Human...
 607 I promise you...
 607 For as long as 698 you remain here...
 601 My wife and I will 698 take care of you 698 as best we can.
 602 We can sit in 698 the living room 611 , 698 telling stories...
 601 Eating butterscotch 698 pie...
 602 We could be 698 like...
 608 Like a family...
You 698 IDIOT.
 620 .
You 698 haven't 698 learned 698 a thing.
Hee 698 hee 698 hee.
So you 698 finally 698 get it.
 620 .
So you 698 DO 698 recall.
In 698 this 698 world...
It's KILL or BE killed 614 .
Hee hee hee 611 . 698 Don't worry.
I know there's no 698 REAL point in 698 fighting you.
The human souls 698 would probably just 698 revolt again.
So...!
Hee hee hee 611 .
Did you REALLY 698 think killing me 698 would make a 698 DIFFERENCE?
No.
Every time you 698 load your SAVE 611 , 698 I'll come back.
And every time you 698 try to get a 698 happy ending...
I'll be there to 698 tear it away!
Ha ha ha!!!
Well 611 , let's get 698 this over with.
...
 602 ...
 600 No 611 . 698 That's just a 698 fantasy 611 , isn't it?
 601 Young one 611 , when I 698 look at you...
 602 I'm reminded of the 698 human that fell here 698 long ago...
 608 You have the same 698 feeling of hope in 698 your eyes.
 607 There is an ancient 698 prophecy among our 698 people...
One day 611 , a savior 698 will come from the 698 heavens.
 601 ... I believe the 698 one that was 698 prophecied was you.
Somewhere in the 698 world outside...
There must be a way 698 to free us from our 698 prison.
 600 It pains me to 698 give you this 698 responsiblity 611 , but...
 600 Please 611 . 698 Take my soul.. 611 . 698 and seek the truth.
 600 Ha... ha...
 606 I'm sorry...
I couldn't give you 698 a simple 611 , happy 698 ending...
But I believe your 698 freedom...
... is what my son...
 608 ... what ASRIEL would 698 have wanted.
See 611 ? 698 I never betrayed 698 you 612 ! 
It was all a 698 trick, see 612 ? 
I was waiting to 698 kill him for you 612 ! 
 601 After all it's me 698 your best friend 612 ! 
 602 I'm helpful, I can 698 be useful to you 611  
 601 I promise I won't 698 get in your way 611  
 602 I can help.. 611 . 698 I can.. 611 . 698 I can.. 612 . 
 603 Please don't 698 kill me.
* How tense...
 602 * Just think of it like...
 600 * A visit to the dentist.
* Are you ready?
 603 * If you are not 611 , I 698   understand.
 602 * I am not ready either.
* ...
* Asgore has low HP.
* ASGORE 80 ATK 80 DEF 
* But there was nothing to 698   say.
* You quietly tell ASGORE 698   you don't want to fight 698   him.
* His hands tremble for a 698   moment.
* You tell ASGORE that you 698   don't want to fight him.
* His breathing gets funny 698   for a moment.
* You firmly tell ASGORE to 698   STOP fighting.
* Recollection flashes in his 698   eyes...
* ASGORE's ATTACK dropped 611 ! 698 * ASGORE's DEFENSE dropped!
* Seems talking won't do any 698   more good.
* All you can do is FIGHT.
* You tell ASGORE that he's 698   killed you  621 .
once before
twice before
three times
four times
five times
six times
seven times
eight times
nine times
too many times 698   to count
* He nods sadly.
* He nods grievously.
* He nods pitifully.
* Dum dee dum...
* Oh 611 ? 698 * Is someone there?
* Just a moment!
* I have almost finished watering 698   these flowers.
* Curious 611 . 698 * I've never seen a plant.. 611 . 698 * Cry before.
* ... Here we are!
* Howdy 611 ! 698 * How can I...
* Oh.
 603 * ...
 602 * I so badly want to 698   say 611 , "would you like 698   a cup of tea?"
* But...
 603 * You know how it is.
* Nice day today 611 , huh?
* Birds are singing 611 , 698   flowers are blooming...
* Perfect weather for a 698   game of catch.
* ...
* You know what we must 698   do.
* When you are ready 611 , 698   come into the next 698   room.
 603 * ... huh?
* You must be the one 698   that flower just warned 698   me about.
 600 * Howdy!
* ...
 603 * Erm.. 611 . 698 * What kind of monster 698   are you...?
 600 * Sorry 611 , I cannot tell.
* Well 611 , we can always
* I'm so sorry.
* Ha.. 611 . ha...
* I don't want to let 698   go...
 607 * Frisk...
* You're...
 600 * You're going to do 698   a great job 611 , OK?
* No matter what you 698   do.
* Everyone will be 698   there for you 611 , 698   okay?
 607 * Well.. 611 . 698 * My time's running out.
* Goodbye.
* By the way...
* Frisk.
 606 * ... take care of Mom 698   and Dad for me 611 , OK?
Finally.
I was so 698 tired of 698 being a 698 flower.
Howdy!
 620  611 , 698 are you 698 there?
It's me 611 , 698 your 698 best 698 friend.
 ASRIEL   DREEMURR 
 601 You know...
 651 I  600 don't care about 698 destroying this 698 world anymore.
 601 After I defeat you 698 and gain total 698 control over the 698 timeline...
 602 I just want to reset 698 everything.
 603 All your progress.. 611 . 698 Everyone's memories.
 602 I'll bring them all 698 back to zero!
 602 Then we can do 698 everything ALL over 698 again.
 603 And you know what 698 the best part of 698 all this is?
 602 You'll DO it.
 601 And then you'll 698 lose to me again.
 603 And again.
 603 And again!!!
 601 Because you want a 698 "happy ending."
Because you "love 698 your friends."
Because you "never 698 give up."
 651 I 601 sn't that 698 delicious?
 650 Your "determination. 611 " 698 The power that let 698 you get this far...
 602 It's gonna be your 698 downfall!
 602 Now 611 , ENOUGH messing 698 around!
It's time to purge 698 this timeline once 698 and for all!

 600 ... even after that 698 attack 611 , you're still 698 standing in my way...?
 651 W 600 ow.. 611 . 698 You really ARE 698 something special.
 650 B 603 ut don't get 698 cocky.
 600 Up until now 611 , I've 698 only been using 698 a fraction of my 698 REAL power!
 602 Let's see what good 698 your DETERMINATION 698 is against THIS!!
*  620  611 , please...
* Wake up!
* You are the future 698   of humans and 698   monsters...
* (It felt strange to lie 698   in the bed.)
* (It feels entirely too 698   small for you now.)
* You feel something faintly 698   resonating within ASRIEL.
* You feel something 698   resonating within ASRIEL.
* You feel something strongly 698   resonating within ASRIEL.
* You feel your friends' SOULs 698   resonating within ASRIEL!
* The whole world is ending.
* You feel something faintly 698   resonating within ASRIEL.
* You feel something 698   resonating within ASRIEL.
* You feel something strongly 698   resonating within ASRIEL.
* You feel your friends' SOULs 698   resonating within ASRIEL!
* ...
* Strangely 611 , as your friends 698   remembered you...
* Something else began resonating 698   within the SOUL 611 , stronger 698   and stronger.
* It seems that there's still 698   one last person that needs 698   to be saved.
* But who...?
* ...
* Suddenly 611 , you realize.
* You reach out and call 698   their name.
* Can't move your body 611 . 698 * Nothing happened.
* You struggle.. 611 . 698 * Nothing happened.
* You tried to reach your 698   SAVE file 611 . 698 * Nothing happened.
* You tried again to reach 698   your SAVE file 611 . 698 * Nothing happened.
* Seems SAVING the game really 698   is impossible.
* SAVING over ASRIEL's file 698   seems like the only way to 698   defeat him...
* But 611 , having never SAVED 698   before 611 , you lack the power 698   to do it.
* Seems SAVING the game really 698   is impossible.
* ...
* But...
* Maybe 611 , with what little 698   power you have...
* You can SAVE something else.
* Can't move your body.
* !?!?
Huh 611 ? What are you 698 doing...!?








Urah ha ha ha... 698 Behold my TRUE power!
I can feel it...
Every time you die 611 , 698 your grip on this 698 world slips away.
Every time you die 611 , 698 your friends forget 698 you a little more.
Your life will end 698 here 611 , in a world 698 where no one 698 remembers you...
Still 611 , you're 698 hanging on...?
That's fine.
In a few moments 611 , 698 you'll forget 698 everything 611 , too.
That attitude will 698 serve you well in 698 your next life!
Ura ha ha...
Still!?
Come on...
Show me what good 698 your DETERMINATION 698 is now!
Ultimate bepis
 601 Wh.. 611 . 698 what did you do...?

 606 Because you're 698 special 611 ,  620 .
You're the only one 698 that understands 698 me.
You're the only one 698 who's any fun to 698 play with anymore.
 604 ...
No...
 601 That's not JUST 698 it.

 604 I'm not ready for 698 this to end.
I'm not ready for 698 you to leave.

AND JUST LET ME 698 WIN!!!

* Dear Diary 611 : 698 * Shyren's sister "fell down" 698   recently.
* It's sad 611 . 698 * Without her sister to 698   speak for her...
* She's become more 698   reclusive than ever.
* So I reached out to her 611 , 698   and told her...
* That she 611 , Blooky 611 , and I 698   should all perform together 698   sometime.

* Only one other person came.
* Honestly 611 , she's a dork 611 . 698 * And she's obsessed with 698   these awful cartoons.
* But she's kind of funny 611 , 698   too....
* I want to see her again.
* Diary... My dear: 698 * My diary collection is 698   going fabulously.
* I have like five now.
* Dear Diary 611 : 698 * She surpised me with 698   something today.
* Sketches of a body that 698   she wants to create for 698   me...
* A form beyond my wildest 698   fantasies.
* In a form like that 611 , I 698   could finally feel 698   like... "myself."
* After all 611 , there's no 698   way I can be a star 698   the way I am now.
* Sorry 611 , Blooky 611 . 698 * My dreams can't wait 698   for anyone...

GUESS THAT'S 698 SETTLED!!
* that worked out 611 , huh?
* Why do I look like a weird 698   black sausage 611 ? 698 * Just the angle.
* As a youth 611 , I would sneak 698   out to play by this creepy 698   flaming pit.
* Since the CORE is always 698   re-arranging 611 , it was like 698   a game trying to find it.
* Now it is my special place 611 . 698 * It is nice for cooking s'mores 698   and things like that.
* We were hired by Mettaton 698   to destroy you.
* But since he never paid us 611 , 698   we all decided to quit.
* No hard feelings.
* Zzzzzzz...
* (It's taking a nap.)
* Why do I look like a black 698   sausage and not a knight 698   or a wizard?
* Well.. 611 . 698 * Everyone has an angle they 698   look best from..
* The core is made up of 698   interchangable rooms.
* Before you came here 611 , the 698   layout was altered so you 698   would get lost and perish.
* Yes 611 . Just for you 611 . 698 * Do you feel special?
* Error.
* (You turned on the sink.)
* (You really like to wash 698   your hands.)
* (You turned off the sink.)
* (You turned on the sink.)
* (There's a red key lying 698   in the sink.)
* (You took it and put it 698   on your keychain.)
 603 I SEE 611 . I SEE.
 600 YOU LIKE CARESSING 698 MY BICEPS WITH A 698 FLOATING HEART.
 601 BUT WHO DOESN'T!?
 600 TRY AGAIN!
 600 THIS SHIRT DIDN'T 698 ORIGINALLY SAY 698 'COOL 611 ,' BUT I 698 IMPROVED IT.
EXPERT TIP 611 : ALL 698 CLOTHING ARTICLES 698 CAN BE IMPROVED 698 THIS WAY.
 601 BUT THAT'S NOT A 698 SECRET!!!
IT'S JUST GOOD 698 ADVICE!!!
 602 HOLDING MY HAND 698 SO I'LL TELL 698 YOU THE ANSWER...
 607 NO!! 611 ! 698 I MUST RESIST!!
 600 THERE'S NO SECRET 698 TO MY LEGS.
JUST HARD WORK 698 AND PERSEVERANCE...
 603 HUMAN SOULS ARE 698 STRONGER THAN 698 MONSTER SOULS...
 600 BUT THE SOLES OF 698 OUR SHOES ON THE 698 OTHER HAND...!
 603 ... ARE ABOUT THE 698 SAME.
HAT DIALOGUE.
 600 I UNDERSTAND 698 WHY YOU'RE 698 RUNNING AWAY.
 602 YOU'RE OVERWHELMED 698 BY THE SIGHT OF 698 MY COOL VIBES.
 600 BUT YOU CAN'T 698 BACK DOWN NOW!!!
 660 * My fave Mettaton Moment(TM) 611 ? 698 * Right  663 when everything looks the 698   baddest 611 , he poses dramatically 660 .
* Like when he's on a cooking 698   show and the eggs don't turn 698   out right.
* But 611 ! 698 * Then he says!
 660 * Even if you suck at cooking 611 , 698   you can always  663 buy an 698   MTT-brand Glamburger 660 !
 660 * Then he  663 eats one 611 ! 660   698 * Everyone loves it!
* ... How does he eat it 698   without a mouth?
* Uhhh... well.. 611 . 698 * Watch the show!
* That finale was really.. 611 . 698 * That was really sad!
* And Mettaton's schedule 698   doesn't show any other 698   shows...
* I've been thinking about 698   getting a sick skateboard.
 660 * My fave Mettaton Moment(TM) 698   is when he beats up the 698    663 heel-turning villains 660 !
* Even if it's during what's 698   supposed to be a quiz show.
* Oh 611 ! And I like when he tries 698   on all kinds of different 698   fashionable outfits!
* Even if it's during what's 698   supposed to be a newscast.
* Did Mettaton retire...?
* Can't he unretire...?
* On the surface we'll be able 698   to watch all kinds of TV...
* But 611 , I bet none of those 698   shows are as good as 698   Mettaton's!
* The door leading through 698   the area is closed 611 ? 698 * So I tried the puzzle?
* But I kept running out of 698   ammo 611 , and it kept restarting?
* And my two co-workers won't 698   help 611 ? It's like they don't 698   even wanna go to work?
* Why don't you try 611 ? 698 * Try using the console?
* Wow 611 ? 698 * You solved it?
* I'm impressed 611 ? 698 * You must be a total nerd?
* So we're all gonna go 698   free...?
* Does that mean I don't 698   get to go to work?
* Maybe I don't want to go 698   to work anymore...?
* Tra la la 611 . 698 * The waters are wild today 611 . 698 * That's good luck...
* Tra la la.

* Tra la la 611 . 698 * Did you ever hear the old 698   song coming from the sea?
* Tra la la 611 . 698 * What's inside an acorn 611 ? 698 * It's really just a mystery.
* Tra la la 611 . 698 * Dancing on a boat is danger 611 . 698 * But good exercise...
* Tra la la 611 . 698 * I heard ASGORE has a favorite 698   food.
* Tra la la 611 . 698 * I heard spiders have a 698   favorite food.

* Tra la la 611 . 698 * The piano plays the 698   tinkling song.

* Ah,

* Asking for a friend...

* Tra la la 611 . 698 * Why don't you sing with me 611 . 698 * Tra la la.
* Tra la la 611 . 698 * Uh oh 611 . 698 * Suddenly 611 , feeling tropical...
* Tra la la 611 . 698 * Hmmm...

* Did something move 611 ? 698 * Was it my imagination?
* I can only see moving 698   things.
* If something WAS moving.. 611 . 698 * For example 611 , a human...
* I'll make sure it NEVER 698   moves again!
* Did something move 611 ? 698 * Was it my imagination?
* I can only see moving 698   things.
* H.. 611 . hey! 698 * I can't stop shivering 698   all of a sudden.
* Who.. 611 . who's there!?
* S-S-S-Something pet me... 698 * Something that isn't 698   m-m-moving...
* I'm gonna need some dog 698   treats for this!!!
* A stick appeared out of 698   nowhere 611 , then disappeared.
* Was it a ghost stick?
* Did I just return it to 698   the afterlife?
* I need some dog treats 698   to think about this.
* (Unfortunately 611 , it's just 698   dry food.)
* (There's a hot dog cut up 698   into the kibble.)
* (It's a half-empty bag 698   of dog food.)
* (It's a bag of dog food. 611 ) 698 * (It's half-full.)
* (It's a half-empty bag 698   of dog food.)
* (...)
* (You just remembered 698   something funny.)
* (It's too dark to see 698   near the walls.)
* (It's too small to sleep 698   on.)
* It's the broken head of 698   a snowdog.
* Seems like the base of a 698   snowdog.
* It's a pile of mushy snow.
* This dog is staring blankly 698   into the snow 611 , waiting for 698   it to turn into art.
* Hello 611 ? 698 * Is anybody there... 611 ? 698 * No?
* Are you two playing a trick 698   on me 611 ? 698 * Real funny.
* Big guy 611 ? 698 * Is that you 611 ? 698 * Come on...
* Well 611 , it's not the tall 698   skeleton.. 611 . 698 * He's too loud.
* Whoever you are 611 , knock it 698   off!!!
* ...
* That dog considers itself 698   an artist 611 , but doesn't ever 698   know what to create.
* It probably doesn't help 698   that its brain is the size 698   of a piece of kibble.
* That dog from earlier... 611 ? 698 * It's at Grillby's 611 . 698 * I think.
* After work 611 , all of the dogs 698   go there to play cards 698   together.
* But that dog doesn't really 698   know how to express itself.
* So 611 , it ends up playing alone 611 , 698   instead of introducing 698   itself to the others...
* A dog just rushed in here 611 , 698   filled with inspiration.
* It kept trying to build 698   a snowdog that expressed 698   its own emotions...
* But 611 , as it built 611 , it 698   kept getting more excited 698   about the sculpture...
* Its neck got longer and 698   longer 611 , and it added more 698   and more snow 611 , until...
* It was rather sad to watch 611 , 698   but I couldn't turn away.
* We're all free?
* OK 611 , OK.. 611 . 698 * I'll stop lounging around 611 . 698 * Does that dog know?
* ... it probably doesn't 611 , 698   does it...?
* (Someone's been smoking 698   dog treats.)

* They saw you and hoped you 698   might TALK to them.
* Perhaps strike up a 698   friendly conversation.
* But NO!!!
* You ran away.. 611 . 698 * And broke their little 698   ethereal heart.
* Despicable 611 . 698 * Despicable 611 ! 698 * DESPICABLE!
* HUMAN 611 ! 698 * I'll show you what REAL 698   heartbreak is!

 600 Why...?
Why did you let me go? 
 607 Don't you realize that 698 being nice...
 601 ... just makes you 698 get hurt?
 600 Look at yourself.
 609 You made all these 698 great friends...
 600 But now 611 , you'll probably 698 never see them again.
 609 Not to mention how 698 much they've been 698 set back by you.
 606 Hurts 611 , doesn't it?
 607 If you had just gone 698 through without caring 698 about anyone...
 606 You wouldn't have to 698 feel bad now.
 600 So I don't get it.
 607 If you really did 698 everything the right 698 way..
 600 Why did things still 698 end up like this?
 606 Why...?
 605 Is life really 698 that unfair?
 609 ...
 600 Say.
 609 What if I told you...
 600 I knew some way 698 to get you a better 698 ending?
 609 You'll have to load 698 your SAVE file, and...
 609 You'll have to 698 start over 611 , and...
 600 Well, in the meantime 611 , 698 why don't you go see 698 Dr. Alphys?
 600 Well 611 , in the meantime 611 , 698 why don't you go see 698 Undyne?
 600 Well 611 , in the meantime 611 , 698 why don't you go see 698 Papyrus 611 , then Undyne?
 609 It seems like you 698 could have been 698 better friends.
Who knows.. 611 . maybe 698 she's got the key 698 to your happiness...?
 604 See you soon.
But 611 , despite everything 611 , 698 your happy ending 698 didn't come.
 605 Why...?
 604 I know why.
 604 Go to Dr. Alphys.
 605 Your date with her 698 has really just 698 begun.
So you went the 698 whole way through 698 without killing...
 605 And then you decided 698 to kill ASGORE?
 606 What the hell is 698 WRONG with you?
 604 You COMPLETELY missed 698 the point.
 602 Are you trolling me?
 600 Because.
 604 No.
 605 You are only 698 trolling yourself.
 606 What a waste of 698 everybody's time.
 607 All you had to 698 do was make friends.
With Papyrus 611 , Undyne 611 , 698 and then Alphys.
 602 But you were too 698 busy messing it up!
Hey.
Since you defeated me.
I've been thinking.
 603 Is killing things 698 really necessary?
 601 I...
 603 I honestly don't 698 know anymore.
 600 I have a request 698 for you.
 604 Prove to me...
 605 Prove to me you 698 are strong enough 698 to survive.
 606 Get here from 698 the beginning.
 600 Without killing a 698 single thing...
 604 ... and I won't 698 kill the king.
 604 ... and 611 , maybe...
 607 Then you'll have 698 your so-called 698 "happy ending."
 606 So 611 , what will 698 it be?
 605 Will you prove 698 yourself?
 608 Or will I get to 698 watch you suffer...?
Either way 611 , I'm 698 interested!!!
 604 Hee hee hee...
Interesting...
 606 So 611 , even with 698 everything you did...
 605 The outcome's still 698 the same.
 609 In the end 611 , your 698 choices were an 698 illusion.
 609 NOTHING you do 698 really matters!
 608 Hee hee hee!
 608 ...
 600 Well.
 606 You DID do what 698 I told you.
 605 I guess it's up 698 to me to get you a 698 REAL happy ending.
 600 For starters 611 , you 698 can't do it by 698 yourself.
Papyrus 611 , Undyne 611 , 698 Alphys.. 611 . these guys.
 604 Are you friends with 698 all of them yet?
 605 Maybe you should go 698 back and.. 611 . "hang" 698 with them.
 604 The power of 698 friendship...
That always saves 698 the day 611 , right?
 600 So 611 , killing people 698 is ACTUALLY fine...?
 604 Sure.
I'm glad we agree on 698 the value of a life.
I've learned SO 698 MUCH from you.
 600 Though.. 611 . are you 698 REALLY gonna keep 698 doing things halfway?
 608 The amount of people 698 you killed...
 609 It's honestly 698 DISAPPOINTING.
 608 You IDIOT.
 604 You really can't do 698 ANYTHING right.
Why 611 ,  620 ...?
 603 Why?
 601 WHY?
 608 We were on our way 698 to REAL victory...
 609 On our way to making 698 up for LAST time!
 602 Why'd you have to 698 SCREW IT UP?
 605 Hahaha...
 609 Is this REVENGE?
 601 Making me watch you 698 act so pure and 698 happy 611 , while I...?
 601 Making me watch you 698 live out your life 611 , 698 while I...?
 601 ...
 607 No.
 608 NO.
I KNOW what you're 698 doing.
You just want to see 698 what it's all like.
Before we TEAR IT 698 AWAY from them.
Ahahaha...
 609 Genius 611 ,  620 .
 604 Well 611 , I'll let you 698 mess around.
 608 I know you'll come 698 back eventually.
 609 And when that time 698 comes...
 604  620 .
 604 I'll be waiting 698 for you.
Why do you keep 698 coming back here?
 605 Oh 611 , I get it 611 . 698 You wanna be friends 611 , 698 huh...?
 608 You're PATHETIC.
 608 You REALLY think I 698 want to be friends 698 with YOU?
 605 Heh...
 609 You really DON'T 698 get it 611 , do you?
 605 There's only one 698 person I could care 698 about anymore.
 606 And even then 611 , I 698 couldn't TRULY care 698 about them.
 605 I just like to think 698 there's someone out 698 there...
Someone that I 698 won't get tired of.
 608 Someone like ME.
 608 ...
 600 Say.
 604 Quit looking at me 698 with that stupid 698 expression.
You're pissing me 698 off.
 600 So you're here 698 again.
 602 What's wrong with 698 you?
 604 Are you trying to 698 start the Flowey 698 Fan Club?
 605 Because if you 698 want to join THAT...
 604 You'll have to 698 talk to Papyrus.
 606 Yeah 611 , he started 698 one.
 605 A few different 698 times 611 , anyway.
 600 I won't lie.
 604 He's one of the 698 better characters 698 to mess around with.
 605 Took me a long 698 time to get bored 698 of that one.
 607 ... Yeah.
 604 Talk to him 698 about it.
 600 So.
 604 Did you start the 698 Flowey Fan Club?
 605 Ha 611 . 698 I'm just kidding.
 609 I was watching 611 . 698 I know you didn't.
 605 But I don't care 611 . 698 Really.
 606 He probably would 698 have invited his 698 garbage brother.
 604 You know 611 . 698 Smiley Trashbag.
 600 ...
 604 Say.
If I have ONE piece 698 of advice for you...
 609 DON'T.
Let his brother.
Find out ANYTHING 698 about you.
 606 He'll.. 611 . well...
 605 Let's just say.
 609 He's caused me more 698 than my fair share 698 of resets.
 604 Stay away from 698 that guy.
 600 Why do you keep 698 coming back here?
You don't REALLY 698 want to be friends 611 , 698 do you...?
...
 604 No 611 . I get it.
You're just like me 611 , 698 aren't you?
You don't care about 698 anyone.
 604 You're just bored.
You just want to 698 see what I'll say.
 605 So you can laugh 698 and throw me away 698 like a broken toy.
 608 Well 611 , TOO BAD!
 609 I'm not LIKE everybody 698 else.
 609 So, from now on...
 604 You're not getting 698 ANYTHING.
...
 604 Don't you have 698 anything BETTER to do?
Hi.
Seems as if everyone 698 is perfectly happy.
Monsters have returned 698 to the surface.
Peace and prosperity 698 will rule across the land.
 606 Take a deep breath.
 605 There's nothing left 698 to worry about.
 607 ...
 606 Well.
 601 There is one thing.
 603 One last threat.
One being with the 698 power to erase 698 EVERYTHING...
 601 Everything everyone's 698 worked so hard for.
 607 ...
 606 You know who I'm 698 talking about 611 , don't 698 you?
 601 That's right.
 604 I'm talking about YOU.
 607 YOU still have the 698 power to reset 698 everything.
 600 Toriel 611 , Sans 611 , Asgore 611 , 698 Alphys, Papyrus, Undyne...
If you so choose...
Everyone will be 698 ripped from this 698 timeline...
... and sent back before 698 all of this 698 ever happened.
 606 Nobody will 698 remember anything.
 605 You'll be able to 698 do whatever you 698 want.
 600 ...
 607 That power.
 603 I know that power.
 606 That's the power 698 you were fighting to 698 stop 611 , wasn't it?
 607 The power that I 698 wanted to use.
 606 But now 611 , the idea 698 of resetting 698 everything...
 607 I...
 601 I don't think I 698 could do it all 698 again.
Not after that.
 607 ...
 601 So, please.
 603 Just let them go.
Let Frisk be happy.
Let Frisk live 698 their life.
 601 ...
 603 But.
If I can't change 698 your mind.
If you DO end up 698 erasing everything...
 607 ...
 606 You have to erase 698 my memories 611 , too.
 607 ...
 606 I'm sorry.
 605 You've probably heard 698 this a hundred times 698 already 611 , haven't you...?
...
 600 Well 611 , that's all.
 606 See you later...

 651 ... so nice to me?
 651 ... why?
 651 ...?
 651 ...
 651 I'll kill everyone you love.
 651 I'll kill everyone.
I'll kill you.
 651 If you let me live...
 651 I'll come back.
 651 Sparing me won't change 698 anything.
 651 Killing me is the only 698 way to end this.
...
 601 What are you doing?
 602 Do you really think I've 698 learned anything from this?
 603 No.
Is this a joke 612 ? 698 Are you braindead 612 ? 698 RUN 612 . INTO 612 . THE. 698 friendliness pellets









stop it
 601 * Hello.. 611 . 698 * Are you all right?
* You must be so lost 698   and confused...
 602 * Ah, do not be 698   afraid 611 , my child.
 660 * I am  664 TORIEL 660 , 698   caretaker of the 698    661 RUINS 660 .
* I pass through here 698   every day to see if 698   anyone has fallen down.
* You are the first 698   human to come here 698   in a long time.
* I will do my best 698   to protect you during 698   your time here.
* Come 611 ! 698 * I shall guide you 698   through the catacombs.
 660 * Howdy 612 ! 698 * I'm 663  FLOWEY 660 . 612   698 *  663 FLOWEY 660  the  663 FLOWER 660 !
* Hee hee hee...
* Why'd you make me 698   introduce myself?
* It's rude to act 698   like you don't 698   know who I am.
* Someone ought to teach 698   you proper manners.
* I guess little old me 698   will have to do.
* Ready 612 ? 698 * Here we go!
* Don't you have anything 698   better to do?
* Error
* Really 611 ,  620 ?
 605 * Well 611 , do what you 698   will.
 604 * I'll be waiting for 698   you!
 600 * Hey 611 . 698 * Remember.
 602 * DON'T kill anyone.
 602 * ...
 601 * I can't believe this 698   is a REAL thing I 698   have to remind you.
 600 * Hee hee hee...
* Good luck!
* Remember...
 601 * THIS time 611 , you've 698   GOT to become friends 698   with everyone.
 602 * OK?
 605 * If you DON'T 611 , you'll 698   be miserable FOREVER.
 601 * And we wouldn't want 698   THAT 611 , would we?
 600 * No.. 611 . 698 * We just want you 698   to be happy 611 , right?
* Good luck. 
* Error
* Hee hee hee...
 602 * I hope you like your 698   choice.
* After all 611 , it's not 698   as if you can go 698   back and change fate.
 600 * In this world 611 , it's kill 698   or be killed.
 602 * That old hag thought 698   she could break the 698   rules.
 601 * She tried so hard 698   to save you humans.
 600 * But when it came 698   down to it...
 683 * 605  Hee hee...
 604 * SHE COULDN'T EVEN 698   SAVE HERSELF.
* WHAT AN IDIOT!!
 602 * Heheheheh.
* You just can't 698   get enough 611 , can you!?
 604 * ...
 606 * How many more 698   times will you 698   kill her?
* Ha ha ha ha ha...
 604 * 683  You disgusting animal.
* You didn't even 698   TRY to spare her.
* Wow 611 , you really 698   can't get enough.
 605 * You kind of remind 698   me of myself.
* Wow 611 , you're utterly 698   repulsive.
 606 * You spared her life...
* Then you decided that 698   just wasn't interesting 698   enough for you.
 607 * So you murdered her 698   just to see what 698   would happen.
 605 * You killed her out 698   of boredom.
* Truly disgusting...
* Hee hee...
 604 * You naive idiot.
* Do you think you 698   are the only one 698   with that power?
 604 * The power to reshape 698   the world...
* Purely by your 698   own determination.
* The ability to 698   play God!
* The ability to "SAVE."
 600 * I thought I was 698   the only one with 698   that power 611 . But...
 601 * I can't SAVE anymore.
* Apparently YOUR 698   desires for this 698   world override MINE.
 605 * Well well.
* Enjoy that power 698   while you can.
 604 * I'll be watching.
* Hahaha...
 601 * You're not really human 611 , 698   are you?
 601 * No. 612  You're empty inside 612 . 698 *  604 Just like me 611 . 698 * In fact...
 608 * You're  620 , 611  right?
 600 * We're still inseparable 611 , 698   after all these years...
* Listen 611 . 698 * I have a plan to become 698   all powerful.
 602 * Even more powerful than 698   you and your stolen 698   soul.
 604 * Let's destroy everything 698   in this wretched world.
 606 * Everyone 611 , everything in 698   these  607 worthless 698   memories...
 605 * Let's turn 'em all 698   to dust.
* Clever. 698 * Verrrryyy clever.
* You think you're really 698   smart 611 , don't you?
 600 * In this world 611 , it's kill 698   or be killed.
 601 * So you were able to 698   play by your own 698   rules.
* 604  You spared the life 698   of a single person.
* Hee hee hee...
* Froggit 611 , Whimsun 611 . 698 * Vegetoid 611 , Loox 611 . 698 * Migosp 611 , Moldsmal.
* Think about those names.
* Do you think any of 698   those monsters have 698   families?
* Do you think any of 698   them have friends?
 606 * Each one could have 698   been someone else's 698   Toriel.
 607 * Selfish brat.
* Somebody is dead 698   because of you.
 602 * I bet you feel 698   really great.
* You didn't kill 698   anybody this time.
 600 * But what will you 698   do if you meet a 698   relentless killer?
* You'll die and you'll 698   die and you'll 698   die.
 601 * Until you tire of 698   trying.
 600 * What will you do 698   then?
 605 * Will you kill 698   out of frustration?
* Or will you give 698   up entirely on 698   this world...
 604 * ... and let ME inherit 698   the power to control 698   it?
 605 * I am the prince of 698   this world's future.
* Don't worry 611 , my little 698   monarch 611 , my plan 698   isn't regicide.
* This is SO much 698   more interesting.
* But don't act so 698   cocky.
* I know what you did.
 606 * You murdered her.
 607 * And then you went 698   back 611 , because you 698   regretted it.
* Ha ha ha ha...
 605 * You naive idiot.
* Do you think you 698   are the only one 698   with that power?
 604 * The power to reshape 698   the world...
* Purely by your 698   own determination.
* The ability to 698   play God!
* The ability to "SAVE."
 600 * I thought I was 698   the only one with 698   that power 611 . But...
 601 * I can't SAVE anymore.
* Apparently YOUR 698   desires for this 698   world override MINE.
 605 * Well well.
* Enjoy that power 698   while you can.
 604 * I'll be watching.
* What's that smell 611 ? 698 * (Where's that smell?)
* If you're a smell 611 ... 698 * (... identify yoursmellf!)
* Hmmm.. 611 . 698 * Here's that weird smell...
* It makes me want to 698   eliminate.
* (... Eliminate YOU!)
* Dogs can pet other dogs?? 611 ? 698 * (A new world has opened 698   up for us...)
* Thanks 611 , weird puppy!
* Weird smells can bring 698   good things.. 611 . 698 * (Friendly fun fetch!)
* Thanks 611 , weird smell 611 ! 698 * (It sure was fun to 698   "stick" together!)
  Frisk!
  This is all just 698   a bad dream...!
  Please 611 , wake up...!
* Oh 611 ! 698 * You are awake 611 ! 698 * Thank goodness!
* W-we were so 698   worried...!
* It felt like you 698   were out forever!
* Yeah 611 ! Any longer and 698   I would have freaked 698   out!
 602 * Tell us next time 698   you decide to take 698   a nap 611 , okay!?
* yeah 611 . 698 * you made papyrus cry 698   like a baby.
WHAT! 611 ! 698 I DIDN'T CRY!! 611 ! 698 I DON'T CRY!!
 603 I JUST.. 611 . 698 CAUGHT SOMETHING 698 IN MY EYE.
* what did you catch?
TEARS!!!
* Now 611 , now.
* The important part 698   is that Frisk is 698   all right.
* Here 611 , Frisk 611 . 698 * Why not drink some 698   tea?
* It'll make you feel 698   better.
* Errr.. 611 . 698 * How about we give 698   them space 611 , first?
 602 * They must be very 698   exhausted.
 608 * Though 611 , from what 611 , 698   I am not certain.
 601 * Frisk.. 611 . 698 * We do not remember 698   exactly what happened.
 601 * There was a flower.. 611 . 698 * And then 611 , everything 698   went white.
 600 * But now the barrier 698   is gone.
* When you are ready 611 , 698   we will all return 698   to the surface.
* It seems the door to 698   the east will lead 698   us there now.
 602 * But before then...
 600 * Perhaps you might 698   want to take a 698   walk?
* You can say goodbye 698   to all of your 698   wonderful friends.
* Do as you wish 611 . 698 * We will all wait 698   for you here.
 604 What a miserable 698 creature 611 , torturing 698 such a poor 611 , 698 innocent, youth...
 600 Do not be afraid 611 , 698 my child.
 600 It is I 611 , TORIEL 611 , 698 your friend and 698 guardian.
 601 At first 611 , I thought 698 I would let you 698 make your journey 698 alone...
 604 But I could not 698 stop worrying about 698 you.
 604 Your adventure must 698 have been so 698 treacherous.
 602 ... and ultimately 611 , 698 it would burden you 698 with a horrible 698 choice.
To leave this place 611 , 698 you would have to 698 take the life of 698 another person.
 602 You would have to 698 defeat ASGORE.
 604 However.. 611 . 698 I realized...
 601 I cannot allow that.
It is not right to 698 sacrifice someone 698 simply to let 698 someone leave here.
 604 Is that not what 698 I have been trying to 698 prevent this 698 whole time?
 601 So 611 , for now 611 , let 698 us suspend this 698 battle.
 604 As terrible as 698 ASGORE is...
 600 He deserves mercy 611 , 698 too.
Tori.. 611 . 698 You 698 came 698 back...!
 605 Do not "Tori" me 611 , 698 Dreemurr!
 602 You pathetic whelp.
If you really wanted 698 to free our kind...
You could have gone 698 through the barrier 698 after you got ONE 698 SOUL...
... taken six SOULs 698 from the humans 611 , then 698 come back and freed 698 everyone peacefully.
 605 But instead 611 , you made 698 everyone live in 698 despair...
Because you would 698 rather wait here 611 , 698 meekly hoping another 698 human never comes.
...
... Tori...
You're right...
I am a miserable 698 creature...
... but 611 , do you think 698 we can at least be 698 friends again?
(Sigh.)
NO 611 , 698 Asgore.
Ngahhhhhh!! 611 ! 698 ASGORE 611 ! Human!!
Nobody fight each 698 other!!!
Everyone's gonna 698 make friends 611 , or 698 else I'll...!!

SHIN-gles!!!
I CHANGED MY 698 MIND!!!
THIS IS THE WORST 698 DAY OF MY LIFE!!!

There are plenty 698 of fish in the 698 sea...
Y-yeah 611 , ASGORE!!
Undyne's totally 698 right about that 698 fish thing!

J-just get to know 698 a really cute 698 fish...?
...
It's a metaphor.
Well.
I think 698 it's a 698 good 698 analogy.
OH MY GOD!
 662 WILL YOU TWO 698 JUST  661 SMOOCH 662   698 ALREADY!?
THE AUDIENCE IS 698 DYING FOR SOME 698 ROMANTIC ACTION!!!
HEY 611 , SHUT UP!!!

Right 611 , 698 Alphys!??
...
Uh 611 , Alphys?

He's 698 right.
LET'S 698 DO 698 IT.
??????????????
Well?? 611 ? Uh?? 611 ? 698 I guess?? 611 ? 698 If you want to?? 611 ? 698 Then????
Don't hold anything 698 back!!!
W-wait!
Not in 698 front of 698 the 698 human!
Uhh 611 , right 611 ! 698 S-sorry 611 , I got a 698 little carried 698 away there.
Hee hee hee.
My child 611 , it 698 seems as if you 698 must stay here 698 for a while.
 606 But looking at 698 all the great 698 friends you have 698 made...
 600 I think...
 607 I think you will 698 be happy here.
H-hey 611 , that 698 reminds me.
Papyrus.. 611 . 698 YOU called 698 everyone here 611 , 698 right?
Well 611 , besides 611 , 698 uh 611 , her.
Uh 611 , anyway.. 611 . 698 If I got here 698 before you...
How did you know 698 how to call 698 everybody?
LET'S 698 JUST 698 SAY...
A TINY 698 FLOWER 698 HELPED 698 ME.
A tiny.. 611 . 698 flower?
 600 You IDIOTS.
 602 While you guys were 698 having your little 698 pow-wow...
 606 I took the human 698 SOULS!
 605 And now 611 , not only 698 are THOSE under my 698 power...
 606 But all of your 698 FRIENDS' SOULS are 698 gonna be mine 611 , too!
 600 Hee hee hee.
 601 And you know what 698 the best part is?
 605 It's all your 698 fault.
 606 It's all because 698 you MADE THEM 698 love you.
 607 All the time you 698 spent listening to 698 them...
 602 Encouraging them.. 611 . 698 Caring about them...
 600 Without that 611 , they 698 wouldn't have come 698 here.
 607 And now 611 , with their 698 souls and the humans' 698 together...
 605 I will achieve my 698 REAL FORM.
 600 Hee hee...
 603 Huh?
 601 WHY am I still 698 doing this?
 607 Don't you get it?
 600 This is all just 698 a GAME.
 603 If you leave the 698 underground satisfied 611 , 698 you'll "win" the 698 game.
 604 If you "win 611 ," you 698 won't want to "play" 698 with me anymore.
 600 And what would I 698 do then?
 606 But this game 698 between us will 698 NEVER end.
 605 I'll hold victory 698 in front of you 611 , 698 just within your 698 reach...
 606 And then tear it 698 away just before 698 you grasp it.
 608 Over 611 , and over 611 , 698 and over...
 605 Hee hee hee.
 601 Listen.
 600 If you DO defeat 698 me 611 , I'll give you 698 your "happy ending."
 607 I'll bring your 698 friends back.
I'll destroy the 698 barrier.
 600 Everyone will 698 finally be 698 satisfied.
 606 But that WON'T 698 happen.
 608 You...!
 600 I'll keep you here 698 no matter what!
 600 Even if it means 698 killing you 698 1,000,000 times!!!!
What?
Do not be afraid 611 , 698 my child...
No matter what 698 happens...
We will always 698 be there to 698 protect you!
THAT'S RIGHT 611 , 698 HUMAN 611 ! 698 YOU CAN 698 WIN!!
JUST DO 698 WHAT I 611 , 698 WOULD 698 DO...
BELIEVE 698 IN YOU!!!
Hey 611 ! Human 611 ! If 698 you got past 698 ME 611 , you can 698 do ANYTHING!
So don't worry 611 ! 698 We're with you 698 all the way!
huh 611 ? 698 you haven't 698 beaten 698 this guy yet?
come on 611 , this 698 weirdo's got 698 nothin' on you.
Technically 611 , it's 698 impossible for you 698 to beat him...
B-but.. 611 . 698 Somehow 611 , I know 698 you can do it!!
Human 611 , for the 698 future of 698 humans and 698 monsters...!
You have to stay 698 determined...!
Urrrgh.. 611 . NO!
Unbelievable!!
This can't be 698 happening...!
You.. 611 . YOU...!
I can't believe 698 you're all so 698 STUPID.
ALL OF YOUR SOULS 698 ARE MINE!!!
Ribbit, 698 ribbit.
Croak, 698 croak.
Hop, 698 hop.
Meow.
(Blushes 698 deeply.) 698 Ribbit..
Shiver, 698 shiver.

* Froggit doesn't seem to 698   know why it's here.
* Froggit hops to and fro.
* The battlefield is filled 698   with the smell of mustard 698   seed.
* You are intimidated by 698   Froggit's raw strength 614 . 698 * Only kidding.
* Froggit seems reluctant 698   to fight you.
* Froggit is trying to 698   run away.
* FROGGIT - ATK 4 DEF 5 698 * Life is difficult for 698   this enemy.
* Froggit didn't understand 698   what you said 611 , but was 698   scared anyway.
* Froggit didn't understand 698   what you said 611 , but was 698   flattered anyway.
Long ago 611 , two races 698 ruled over Earth 611 : 698 HUMANS and MONSTERS.  601   611  
One day 611 , th 617 ey all 698 disappeared without 698 a trace.

* Alphys might work faster 611 . 698 * But the old Royal Scientist 611 , 698   Doctor W.D. Gaster?
* One day 611 , he vanished 698   without a trace.
* They say he shattered 698   across time and space.
* Ha ha.. 611 . 698 * How can I say so 698   without fear?
* I'm holding a piece of 698   him right here.
* It makes sense why ASGORE 698   took so long to hire a 698   new Royal Scientist.
* After all 611 , the old one.. 611 . 698 * Dr. Gaster 611 . 698 * What an act to follow!
* They say he created the CORE.
* However 611 , his life.. 611 . 698 * Was cut short.

* Greater Dog decides you are 698   too boring.
* You pet the dog.
* Tummy rubs are forbidden.
* You pet decisively 611 . 698 * Pet capacity reaches 100 698   percent.
* The dog flops over with 698   its legs hanging in the air.
* As you pet the dog 611 , 698   it sinks its entire weight 698   into you...
* Your movements slow.
* But 611 , you still haven't 698   pet enough...!
* Greater Dog's excitement is 698   creating a power field that 698   prevents petting.
* Greater Dog curls up in 698   your lap as it is 698   pet by you.
* It gets so comfortable 698   it falls asleep...
* Zzzzz...
* ...
* Then it wakes up 611 ! 698 * It's so excited!

* Greater Dog is not excited 698   enough to play with.
* I'm thinking of getting a 698   spiked collar to show off 698   my personality.
* It makes a statement like.. 611 . 698 * "Attach a leash to me and 698   take me for a walk please."
* He may not look like it 611 , 698   but this big guy writes 698   the most eloquent letters.
* Here 611 , take a look!
* (It's just the word "Bark" 698   but in flowery cursive.)
* Papyrus 611 ? 698 * Is that you 611 ? 698  Come on...
* Undyne! 611 ? 698 * Did you come all the way 698   out here...?
* Huh 611 ? 698 * Since when did you and 698   Sans become friends...?
* I don't like him.. 611 . 698 * He loves to appear without 698   moving.
* Where're the other two 611 ? 698 * I can't play with this 698   big dumb guy alone...
* He'll just win!!!
* Sometimes the others like to 698   prank me 611 . They sit still 698   so I can't see them.
* They must be here 611 , playing a 698   joke on me.
* I'll just wait until one of 698   them admits it...
* Having an amorphous 611 , 698   shambling family member 698   is great.
* They're always moving 611 , so I 698   can see them 100-percent 698   of the time!
* Hmmm.. 611 . 698 * Isn't human food different 698   from monster food?
* It does things like "spoil."
* And when you eat it 611 , it 698   passes all the way through 698   your whole body.
* Disgusting.
* I'd love to try it sometime.
* And I've heard they have 698   things called bathrooms.
* To a human 611 , monster food 698   would be very interesting.
* As soon as you eat it 611 , it 698   converts perfectly into 698   energy.
* ... that makes me wonder 611 . 698 * How do humans do it?
* Eat during battle...?
* Ice cream in one hand 611 , 698   sword in the other.
* That's the way of the 698   monster warrior...
* Hmmm 611 , this is around the 698   time that Sans comes in.
* Then 611 , a little bit later 611 , 698   his brother comes in 611 , 698   irritated.

* He's an interesting fellow.
* He always orders a glass of 698   milk...
* He says it's "full of 698   strong bones."
* Hope he shows up today.
* Soon 611 , I'll be able to try 698   some human food...
* And then I guess I'll try 698   a human bathroom 611 , too.
* Sans is interesting 611 . 698 * He has told me about all 698   kinds of incredible foods.
* But 611 , despite his knowledge 611 , 698   he always orders the worst 698   burger off the menu.
* .. 611 . 698 * .. 611 . 698 * .. 611 .
* Grillbz said that he'd offer 698   you a glass of water 611 , but he 698   doesn't touch the stuff.

* Those dogs are part of 698   the ROYAL GUARD 611 , the elite 698   military group led by UNDYNE.
* She's rude 611 , loud 611 , and beats up 698   everybody who gets in her 698   way...
* It's no wonder all the kids 698   want to be like her when 698   they grow up!
* I want to be like UNDYNE 698   when I grow up 611 , too 611 ! 698 * Hoo hoo hoo!
* Sans is a sentry 611 . 698 * But don't let his title make 698   you think he does anything.
 660 * Everyone knows he sits 698   around in the forest 698   reading  663 car magazines 660 .
* Ehhhhhhhhnnnnn.. 611 . 698 * I wish I had something else 698   to do.
* Those dogs are part of 698   the ROYAL GUARD 611 , the...
* Huh 611 ? 698 * Where are they?
* Something feels really off.
* Wow 611 , a brand new world...
* I might not get to 698   translate for Grillby 698   anymore...
* ... which is fine 611 , since I 698   was actually just making 698   up what he was saying.
* Grillby is getting nervous.
* Sans is his best customer 611 , 698   and he hasn't shown up 698   at all today...
* Something feels really bad 611 . 698 * Our lives are going nowhere 611 , 698   aren't they...?
* I think I need another 698   espresso...
* No matter where I go 611 , 698   it's the same menu 611 , the 698   same people...
* Help 611 ! 698 * I want new drinks an' 698    611 h- 611 h- 611 h-hot guys!!!!

* C'mon Sansy 611 ! 698 * You're the life of the 698   party...
* (It's playing poker against 698   itself.)
* (It appears to be losing.)
* (It has switched to Go Fish.)
* (It finally won a game of 698   poker against itself...?)
* You better watch where you 698   sit down in here 611 , kid.
* Because that big guy WILL jump 698   into your lap and give you 698   lots of love and attention.
* Where's Sans.. 611 . 698 * He's supposed to give me 698   a pat on the head...
* She hasn't been responding 698   to our letters...
* Maybe it's because we let 698   Doggo write them all.
* I was hoping Sans came in 698   to give me a pat on the 698   head.
* Interloper...!

 602 * This was probably just 698   a big inconvenience 698   for you...
 604 * B-but I appreciate 698   that you came here 698   to back me up!
 604 * As I said 611 , I was 698   afraid I might...
 608 * Not come back...
 605 * But that's not because 698   of these guys or 698   anything!
 604 * I was just worried I 698   would be too afraid...
 609 * To tell the truth...
 608 * That I might run away 611 , 698   or do something...
 609 * Cowardly.
* ...
* 608  Uh.. 611 . I.. 611 . 698 * I suppose I owe you 698   an explanation.
 609 * As you probably know 611 , 698   ASGORE asked me to study 698   the nature of SOULs.
 603 * During my research 611 , I 698   isolated a power I 698   called "determination."
 606 * I injected it into dying 698   monsters so their SOULs 698   would last after death.
 609 * But the experiment 698   failed.
* You see 611 , unlike humans', 698   monsters' bodies don't 698   have enough...
* Physical matter to take 698   those concentrations 698   of "determination."
* Their bodies started to 698   melt 611 , and lost what 698   physicality they had.
 603 * Pretty soon 611 , all of the 698   test subjects had melted 698   together into...
 608 * Those.
 609 * Seeing them like this 611 , 698   I knew...
 608 * I couldn't tell their 698   families about it.
 608 * I couldn't tell anyone 698   about it.
 609 * No matter how much 698   everyone was asking me.
 609 * And I was too afraid to 698   do any more work 611 , 698   knowing...
 608 * ... everything I'd done 698   so far had been such 698   a horrific failure.
 609 * ... but now.
 609 * Now 611 , I've changed my 698   mind about all this.
 609 * I'm going to tell 698   everyone what I've done.
 609 * ...
* It's going to be hard.
* Being honest.. 611 . 698 * Believing in myself...
* I'm sure there will be 698   times where I'll 698   struggle.
* I'm sure there will be 698   times where I screw 698   up again.
 600 * But knowing 611 , deep down 611 , 698   that I have friends 698   to fall back on...
 607 * I know it'll be a 698   lot easier to stand 698   on my own.
* Thank you.
* Come on 611 , guys.
* It's time for everyone 698   to go home.

STOP IT!!
STOP IT NOW!!!
* ...
* So you finally made it.

* In a few moments 611 , you 698   will meet the king.
* Together...
* You will determine the 698   future of this world.
* That's then.
* Now.
* You will be judged.
* You will be judged for 698   your every action.
* You will be judged for 698   every EXP you've earned.
* What's EXP?
* It's an acronym.
 660 * It stands for " 661 execution 698   points 660 ."
* A way of quantifying the 698   pain you have inflicted on 698   others.
* When you kill someone 611 , 698   your EXP increases.
* When you have enough EXP 611 , 698   your LOVE increases.
* LOVE 611 , too 611 , is an 698   acronym.
 660 * It stands for " 661 Level of 698   Violence 660 ."
* A way of measuring someone's 698   capacity to hurt.
* The more you kill 611 , the 698   easier it becomes to 698   distance yourself.
* The more you distance 698   yourself 611 , the less you 698   will hurt.
* The more easily you 698   can bring yourself to 698   hurt others.
* So you finally made it...
* Now 611 , you understand.
* It's time to begin your 698   judgment.
* Look inside yourself.
* Have you really done the 698   right thing?
* And 611 , considering what 698   you've done...
* What will you do now?
* Take a moment to think 698   about this.
 628 * ...
 629 * 600  ... but you 611 . 698 * you never gained 698   any LOVE.
 601 * 'course 611 , that doesn't 698   mean you're completely 698   innocent or naive.
 600 * just that you kept 698   a certain tenderness 698   in your heart.
* no matter the struggles 698   or hardships you 698   faced...
* you strived to do the 698   right thing.
* you refused to hurt 698   anyone.
* even when you ran 698   away 611 , you did it 698   with a smile.
* you never gained LOVE 611 , 698   but you gained love.
* does that make sense?
* maybe not.
 603 * .. 611 . 698 * now.
 600 * you're about to face 698   the greatest challenge 698   of your entire journey.

 601 * but you didn't get 698   this far by giving 698   up 611 , did you?
 600 * that's right.
* you have something 698   called "determination."

* huh 611 ? 698 * you look bored.
 601 * i get the feeling 698   you aren't gonna learn 698   anything from this.
 600 * well 611 , guess I gotta 698   judge you then.
* come on 611 . 698 * really?
* lv2.. 611 . 698 * seems like you messed 698   up the slightest amount.
 601 * welp 611 . 698 * that's pretty sad.
 603 * you probably weren't 698   even aware of what you 698   were doing...
* and when you learned 611 , 698   it was too late.
 602 * nah 611 , just kidding.
 601 * who gets to lv2 on 698   accident 611 ? 698 * get outta here.
 603 * lv3...
 601 * 3's just an ok number 611 , 698   i guess.
 602 * i'll give you a C+.
 601 * you can do better 611 , 698   right?
 603 * hmmm.. 611 . 698 * over lv3 611 , huh.
 600 * you killed some people 698   on purpose 611 , didn't you?
 601 * that's probably bad.
 603 * though 611 , maybe some 698   of it was in self- 698   defense...
 601 * i don't know 611 . 698 * help me out here.
* i wasn't watching.
 602 * anyways 611 , don't do that.
 603 * hmmm.. 611 . 698 * over lv9 611 , huh.
 600 * that's over halfway to 698   lv20 611 , the maximum.
 601 * but don't think that 698   means you're still 50- 698   percent good.
 603 * 50-percent 611 , 20-percent.
 604 * those are both still 698   failing grades.
 601 * besides 611 . 698 * chances are...
* i've already tried to 698   steer you in the right 698   direction.
 600 * so what can i say?
 603 * what can i say that 698   will change the mind of 698   a being like you...?
 603 * hmmm.. 611 . 698 * over lv14 611 , huh.
 601 * well 611 , hmmm.. 611 . 698 * judgment-wise...
 604 * you're a pretty bad 698   person.
* you wander around 611 , 698   looking for people...
* killing them to take 698   their money.
 603 * that's just plain 698   messed up.
 601 * and what's worse 611 , is 698   that as bad as you 698   are...
 602 * you aren't anywhere near 698   as bad as you could 698   be.
 601 * you pretty much suck 698   at being evil.
 601 * honestly 611 , it's super 698   embarrassing.
 602 * but maybe you'd be 698   better...
 601 * at not killing anyone?
 602 * crazy idea 611 , huh?
 600 * let me know how that 698   one goes.
* ... huh?
 600 * what's with that look 698   in your eye?
 603 * did you go through and 698   kill someone...
 603 * just to see what i'd 698   say about it?
 601 * wow 611 .
 602 * you're a pretty gross 698   person 611 , huh?

 601 * like you've seen it 698   all before.
 603 * so.. 611 . 698 * i have a request for 698   you.
 660 * 601  i kind of have a 698    663 secret codeword 660   698   that only i know.
 600 * so i know if someone 698   tells it to me...
 601 * they'll have to be a 698   time traveller.
 602 * crazy 611 , right?
 601 * anyway 611 , here it is...
 603 * (whisper 611 , whisper)

 601 * wow 611 . 698 * i can't believe you 698   would say that.
 603 * not only is that 698   completely infantile...
 602 * but it's also my 698   secret codeword.
 603 * that 611 , however 611 , isn't 698   good enough.
 660 * 601  what you need is the 698    663 secret 660  secret codeword.
 602 * it's only for people 698   that know the secret 698   codeword.
 600 * anyway 611 , here it is...

 603 * but soon...
 604 * you'll need to find 698   a mutant hand with 698   even more fingers.
 600 * hmm 611 . 698 * that expression...
 601 * that's the expression 698   of someone who's died 698   seven times in a row.
 600 * hey 611 , that's good 611 . 698 * seven's supposed to be 698   a lucky number.
 602 * who knows 611 , maybe 698   you'll hit the 698   jackpot...
 604 * and that number will 698   multiply tenfold.
 600 * hmm 611 . 698 * that expression...
 601 * that's the expression 698   of someone who's died 698   eight times in a row.

* she's enstated a new 698   policy...
 603 * all the humans who fall 698   here will be treated 698   not as enemies...
 600 * but as friends.
 601 * it's probably for the 698   best 611 , anyway.
 600 * the human souls the king 698   gathered...
 603 * seem to have 698   disappeared.
 601 * so 611 , uh 611 , that plan 698   ain't happening any 698   time soon.
* but even though people 698   are heartbroken over 698   the king...
 601 * ... and things are 698   looking grim for our 698   freedom...
 600 * the queen's trying her 698   best not to let us 698   give up hope.
 601 * so 611 , uh 611 , hey...
 601 * if we're not giving 698   up down here...
 602 * don't give up wherever 698   you are 611 , ok?

 600 AND 611 , WE'RE HELPING 698 DR. ALPHYS 698 WITH HER RESEARCH!

UNDYNE IS HELPING 698 HER TOO!
 603 THOUGH 611 , TO BE 698 HONEST 611 , HER METHOD 698 OF HELPING...
 602 SEEMS KIND OF...
 603 EXPLOSION-INDUCING.

 605 UH OH!!!
 600 HEY!! 611 ! HUMAN!!!

 603 WELL, BESIDES ONE 698 THING...
 603 THE QUEEN 698 DISBANDED THE 698 ROYAL GUARD.
SINCE WE DON'T 698 HAVE TO FIGHT 698 HUMANS ANYMORE.
 600 WOW!!!
 603 I HAVE NO IDEA 698 WHAT TO DO 698 WITH MY LIFE.
 600 BUT 611 , THAT'S 698 OKAY!
BECAUSE I'M 698 STILL WORKING 698 HARD!
 604 EVEN IF IT'S 698 ON NOTHING AT 698 ALL!
 600 SO DON'T FEEL 698 BAD!
PAPYRUS IS FINE!
 605 UNDYNE IS THE 698 ONE THAT'S GOT 698 IT BAD!
 603 SHE LOST HER 698 JOB...
THEN SHE LOST 698 HER HOUSE...
 602 IT WAS SAD.. 611 . 698 BUT WE'RE TAKING 698 CARE OF HER!
 600 SHE LIVES ON 698 OUR COUCH NOW.
IT'S LIKE A 698 SLEEPOVER EVERY 698 NIGHT!
A SLEEPOVER 698 THERE'S NO 698 ESCAPE FROM.
OH 611 , WE GAVE HER 698 A JOB 611 , TOO.
 603 SANS HIRED HER AT 698 HIS ILLEGAL HOT 698 DOG STAND.
 605 SHE HATES WORKING 698 THERE!
 603 BUT SHE MAKES 698 A MEAN HOT DOG.
 603 ...
 605 OH YEAH.
I DON'T KNOW HOW 698 TO PUT THIS 611 , 698 BUT...
 603 SHE 611 , UM 611 , REALLY 698 HATES YOU NOW.
 606 EVEN MORE THAN 698 SHE EVER HAS.
IT'S BECAUSE SHE 698 MADE FRIENDS WITH 698 YOU 611 , THEN...
 605 SHE SAID YOU 698 KILLED SOMEONE?
 603 I KNOW 611 , THAT 698 SOUNDS RIDICULOUS 698 DOESN'T IT?
 606 BUT SHE FEELS SO 698 HURT AND BETRAYED.
AND ANGRY AT 698 HERSELF 611 , TOO.
SHE SAYS...
SHE DOESN'T 698 UNDERSTAND WHY...
SHE EVER LET 698 HERSELF BECOME 698 FRIENDS WITH YOU.
THAT SHE KNEW 698 WHAT HUMANS WERE 698 LIKE...
 603 AND YET SHE 698 STILL FAILED TO 698 RESIST.
 606 MORE PEOPLE GOT 698 HURT BECAUSE OF 698 HER MISTAKE.
 605 I REALLY CAN'T 698 UNDERSTATE.
HOW MUCH SHE 698 HATES YOU.
 606 IT PAINS ME TO 698 SAY THIS 611 , BUT...
YOU SHOULD 698 PROBABLY NEVER 698 COME BACK HERE.
 603 IF YOU DO 611 , UNDYNE 698 WILL DEFINITELY 698 DESTROY YOU.
 605 NOT EVEN THE QUEEN 698 CAN STOP HER.
 606 SO 611 , UH.. 611 . 698 GOODBYE FOREVER.
I'LL MISS YOU 611 , 698 MY FRIEND.
 605 AND YOU MADE 698 ASGORE DISAPPEAR?
 603 AND MADE ALPHYS 698 DISAPPEAR 611 , TOO.
 606 SHE'S NOT VERY 698 HAPPY.
SHE SAYS THINGS 698 LIKE...
"I COULDN'T PROTECT 698 HER..."
IT'S HARD TO GET 698 HER TO DO ANYTHING 698 NOW.
 605 I EVEN SUGGESTED 698 WE TRY TO GET 698 REVENGE ON YOU.
 600 YOU KNOW 611 , SO I 698 COULD SEE YOU 698 AGAIN.
 605 BUT SHE JUST 698 LOOKED AT ME AND 698 SAID...
 606 REVENGE WON'T BRING 698 ANYBODY BACK.
 603 I HAVE NO IDEA 698 WHAT YOU DID 611 , 698 BUT...
 605 CAN YOU PLEASE 698 BRING BACK HER 698 FRIENDS?
IF YOU MADE THEM 698 DISAPPEAR?

 603 ...
 603 SHE TALKS TO ME 698 A LOT...
 605 ABOUT GETTING 698 REVENGE ON YOU.
SHE HAS A 698 LUDICROUS PLAN...
TO CROSS THE 698 BARRIER AND 698 BEAT YOU UP.
 603 TO BE HONEST 611 , 698 I THINK IT'S 698 IMPOSSIBLE.
 600 BUT I'D LIKE TO 698 BELIEVE IT'S 698 NOT!!!
CAUSE I WANT TO 698 GO WITH HER!
THEN I'D GET TO 698 SEE YOU AGAIN!

 600 * Well 611 , she's the 698   same as ever.
 604 * Maybe a little more 698   reclusive than 698   normal.
 607 * Seems like something's 698   really bothering 698   her...
 601 * But she can get 698   through it!
 602 * I'm there supporting 698   her!!
 609 * That's what friends 698   are for 611 , right?
 609 * ...
 600 * Hey 611 , where-ever you 698   are...

 604 * B-but I kinda have 698   no idea what I'm 698   doing.
 600 * I'll figure it out 698   eventually 611 , though.
 603 * The queen is a lot 698   different from 698   ASGORE...
 607 * She actually checks to 698   see if I'm doing 698   anything.
 600 * She's really turned 698   this whole place 698   around!
 602 * ...
 603 * Oh 611 ! 698 * Hey 611 ! 698 * Wait a second!

IF SHE KNEW WHO 698 WE WERE TALKING 698 TO...

WE HAVE THE 698 MERCY TO SPARE 698 YOU FROM HER!!
* B-but 611 , if you want 698   to 611 , call and talk 698   to her any time.
* Yeah 611 ! 698 * She'd be happy to 698   hear from ya!
* oh 611 , whoops.
 600 * this thing's almost 698   outta batteries.
 601 * so 611 , hate to cut this 698   short 611 , but...
 602 * be seeing you 611 , ok 611 , 698   buddy?
BYE BYE FOR NOW!
* See ya 611 , punk!
* G-good.. 611 . 698 * Good...
 604 * Hey 611 , why do I 698   have to be the one 698   to hang up?
 607 * Eheheh.. 611 . 698 * I hate goodbyes...
 603 * Um 611 , we'll see you 698   again someday!
* (Click...)
* so.. 611 . 698 * it's been a while.
 600 * the queen returned 611 , and 698   attempted to resume 698   ruling the underground.
* she enstated a new 698   policy...
 603 * all the humans who fall 698   here would be treated 698   not as enemies...
 600 * but as friends.
 603 * ...
 601 * but people REALLY 698   didn't like that 698   policy.
 600 * because of you 611 , not 698   only was the king 698   gone...
 603 * but the human souls 698   had gone missing as 698   well...
* along with the lives 698   of countless citizens.
* along with the life 698   of...
* along with the life 698   of undyne 611 , their 698   greatest hero.
* along with the lives 698   of countless citizens.
* nobody wanted to see 698   that happen ever again.
 600 * so the people started 698   a rebellion to 698   overthrow the queen.
 602 * but 611 , she 611 , uh 611 , pretty 698   much gave up peacefully 698   when she realized.
 601 * so she went back 698   to the ruins.
 600 * the underground's 698   basically an uneasy 698   anarchy now.
 600 * everyone's trying to 698   live life like they 698   always have...
 603 * but it's not really 698   easy 611 , you know?
* when all of your 698   hope has pretty much 698   been thrown away...
* ...
 601 * undyne spearheaded 698   the revolution 611 , of 698   course.
 603 * she was pretty mad 698   after what happened 698   to asgore.
 603 * she was pretty mad 698   after what happened 698   to asgore and alphys.
 601 * she threw the queen 698   out of the castle 698   with her strength.
 600 * then she became the 698   empress of the 698   underground...
* and banished the 698   queen back to the 698   ruins.
 601 * seems like undyne's.. 611 . 698 * hmmm...
 603 * even more vehement 698   about destroying 698   humanity than ASGORE.
 601 * ...
 602 * but hey 611 ! 698 * it's not all bad!
 600 * she's not so lonely 698   anymore.
 601 * me and papyrus go 698   and visit her...
 600 * we bring her books 698   from the library 611 , 698   or play games...
 602 * we've even convinced 698   her to leave 698   sometimes.
 601 * as long as me or 698   papyrus stay behind 698   to watch for humans.
 602 * but papyrus loves 698   doing that.
YEAH!! 611 ! 698 I LOVE STANDING IN 698 FOR THE QUEEN!!!
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING 698 FOR WHEN A HUMAN 698 COMES.
I'M GOING TO BE 698 A GREAT MOM!!!
 603 BY THE WAY 611 , 698 WHO ARE YOU 698 TALKING TO?
* oh 611 , nobody.
OH, COOL 611 . 698 TELL THEM I SAY 698 HI!!!
* papyrus says hi.
 600 * well 611 , i hope things 698   are better where 698   you are.
 602 * later.
 602 * but hey 611 ! 698 * it's not all bad!
 601 * when the queen went 698   back to the ruins...
 602 * i decided to go 698   with her.
 601 * and i took out some 698   books from the 698   library 611 , too.
 601 * so she won't have 698   to read the same 698   ones.
 600 * she's a good roomie 611 . 698 * we have a lot of 698   fun.
 601 * ...
 601 * you know.
 601 * sometimes the queen 698   talks about...
 600 * how she'd like to 698   see you again.
 601 * isn't that nice?
 603 * ...
 603 * i don't have the 698   heart to tell her 698   what you did.
 600 * do you know how she'd 698   react?
 603 * if i told her that 698   'cause she protected 698   you...
 604 * ... you went on to 698   kill my brother...?
 603 * ...
 601 * anyway 611 , never come 698   back here.
 600 * you are not welcome.
 602 * later.
* since you left 611 , 698   things down here...
 603 * are different.
* with ASGORE gone...
 600 * undyne became the 698   ruler of the 698   underground.
 603 * she's decided to 698   destroy every human 698   that comes here.
 603 * and since the human 698   souls disappeared...
 600 * she's also looking 698   for a new way to 698   break the barrier...
* and when she does 611 , 698   she's going to wage 698   war on humanity.
 601 * i mean 611 , that was 698   asgore's plan 611 , too.
 602 * but he was really 611 , 698   uh 611 , bad at it.
 600 * undyne has also 698   expanded the royal 698   guard massively.
* she says the first 698   thing she'll do after 698   we get out of here...
* is take her army...
 603 * and personally hunt 698   you down and destroy 698   you.
 601 * meanwhile...
* i've been knocking 698   on the door to 698   the RUINs...
 603 * but the woman that's 698   there hasn't been 698   answering me.
 601 * maybe she's not 698   feeling well?
 603 * heh.
 604 * or maybe she's not 698   feeling anything at 698   all...?
 604 * you'd better watch 698   yourself 611 , kid.
 604 * things are lookin 698   real bad for you.
 601 * meanwhile...
 603 * i've been knocking on 698   the door to the 698   RUINS...
 603 * but that woman hasn't 698   been answering me...
 601 * maybe she's not 698   feeling well?
HEY 611 , SANS 611 , WHO ARE 698 YOU TALKING TO?
* oh 611 , just the human.
OH 611 , COOL.
 603 ...
 605 WAIT, DID YOU 698 SAY THE HUMAN!?
 600 CAN I TALK TO 698 THEM???
* sure 611 , knock yourself 698   out.
HEY!! 611 ! 698 UNDYNE'S THE 698 EMPRESS NOW!!
IT'S AMAZING!!!
AND SHE APPOINTED 698 ME TO BE...
THE MOST IMPORTANT 698 ROYAL POSITION!!!
 603 ...
 603 THAT'S IT 611 . 698 THAT'S LITERALLY 698 THE TITLE.
 600 WHAT DO I DO?

 601 * since you left 611 , things 698   have.. 611 . 698 * gotten interesting.
 600 * with ASGORE gone 611 , the 698   people looked to 698   undyne to rule...
 603 * but she was nowhere 698   to be found.
 602 * so mettaton just 698   kind of.. 611 . 698 * took over?
 601 * he's brainwashed 698   everyone with his 698   stupid TV show.
* and made the 698   underground into his 698   personal paradise.
 603 * it's honestly.. 611 . 698 * kinda disturbing.
 601 * as for me 611 ? 698 * oh 611 , yeah...
 602 * i'm his agent.
 600 * HEY THERE 611 , DARLING!

 601 * ...
 603 * REALLY THOUGH. 698 * I REALIZED I WAS...
 604 * NOT THE GREATEST 698   TO HER.
 601 * SO I WENT TO 698   APOLOGIZE.
 609 * AND, TO ASK HER 698   TO HELP ME RULE.
 601 * ...
 603 * BUT I COULDN'T FIND 698   HER.

 600 AND IMAGINE SANS 698 WEARING SUNGLASSES 698 BEING A BOUNCER.
THAT'S OUR LIFE.. 611 . 698 IT'S SO COOL!!!
THINGS HAVE GOTTEN 698 WAY BETTER SINCE 698 YOU CAME HERE!!!
 603 WELL 611 , MINUS THE 698 FACT THAT 698 EVERYTHING SUCKS...
 605 FOR ANYONE THAT 698 DOESNT WORSHIP 698 METTATON.
 603 AND MINUS THE FACT 698 THAT MY FRIEND 698 UNDYNE IS MISSING.
WHO KNOWS WHERE 698 SHE WENT.
SHE NEVER LIKED 698 METTATON'S SHOW.
 603 PEOPLE WHO DON'T 698 TEND TO KIND OF...
 605 DISAPPEAR.
 606 I MISS HER A 698 LOT SOMETIMES.
 600 IF YOU SEE HER 611 , 698 CAN YOU TELL HER 698 I SAID HI?
THANKS 611 ! 698 SEE YOU LATER!
 603 * so. 611 . 698 * it's been a while.
* since you left...
 601 * things have gotten 698   really strange.
 600 * overnight 611 , a bunch of 698   people mysteriously 698   disappeared.
 603 * as well as the 698   human souls.
 603 * people were heart- 698   broken. everyone they 698   looked up to...
* everything they were 698   relying on 611 , in one 698   night, disappeared.
* everyone clamored to 698   elect a new ruler as 698   fast as possible.
 601 * so 611 , uh.. 611 . 698 * by process of 698   elimination...
 602 * papyrus became the 698   ruler?
 601 * why doesn't he talk 698   to you about this...
 600 HELLO!! 611 ! 698 HUMAN!!!
 603 IT'S STRANGE.
 603 ASGORE 611 , ALPHYS 611 , 698 METTATON 611 , AND 698 UNDYNE WENT AWAY.
 600 SANS SAYS THEY 698 WENT ON VACATION.
I HOPE THEY'RE 698 HAVING FUN!!!
 603 OH YEAH.
 600 I'M THE RULER OF 698 THE UNDERGROUND 698 NOW!!!
EVERYTHING IS 698 IMPROVING A LOT 698 HERE.
PRODUCTIVITY IS UP!
BECAUSE I TELL 698 EVERYONE TO KEEP 698 WORKING.
AND 611 , NO ONE GOES 698 HUNGRY!!!
BECAUSE I COOK 698 EVERYONE 698 SPAGHETTI.
 603 MEANWHILE 611 , MY 698 BROTHER HANDLES 698 THE PAPERWORK.
 603 STRANGELY.. 611 . 698 HE SEEMS TO BE 698 WORKING HARD?
 603 THIS SOUNDS MESSED 698 UP.. 611 . BUT...
 605 I'M PROUD.. 611 . 698 OF HIM???
OH NO!!!!
 600 AS FOR OUR HUMAN 698 POLICY...
 603 WE'VE DECIDED 611 , UM.
SANS 611 , WHAT WAS IT?
 602 * we can't judge 698   humans to be all 698   good or all bad.
 600 RIGHT 611 ! 698 SO IT'S CASE-BY- 698 CASE!
IF THEY'RE EVIL.. 611 . 698 WE GIVE THEM 698 PUZZLES!
IF THEY'RE GOOD.. 611 . 698 WE ALSO GIVE 698 THEM PUZZLES!
THAT SEEMS TO BE 698 THE BEST WAY!
 600 ...
 603 ...
IS SANS GONE?
 606 YOU KNOW...
DON'T TELL MY 698 BROTHER, BUT...
DESPITE THE 698 IMPROVEMENTS 698 WE'VE MADE...
SOMETIMES THIS JOB 698 IS KIND OF HARD.
SINCE THE KING 698 WENT AWAY...
LOTS OF PEOPLE 698 JUST WANT TO 698 GIVE UP.
SOMETIMES, EVEN MY 698 BEST 698 ENCOURAGEMENT...
DOESN'T WORK.
AND 611 , AND 611 , I MISS 698 UNDYNE 611 , TOO.
SHE NEVER ANSWERS 698 MY PHONE CALLS...
 605 SHE MUST BE 698  HAVING A LOT OF 698 FUN ON VACATION.
 606 I JUST WISH SHE'D 698 SEND A POSTCARD.
...
 605 BUT HEY!!!
 604 I WON'T GIVE UP!
I CAN'T GIVE UP!
I HAVE TO MAKE 698 EVERYONE GIVE UP 698 GIVING UP!
 600 WE'LL GET OUT 698 OF HERE 611 , SLOWLY!!!
THEN WE CAN ALL 698 HANG OUT AGAIN!!!
 600 NYEH HEH HEH!!!
 603 * it's been a while 611 , 698   huh?
* ...
* things have gotten 698   pretty bad here.
 600 * everyone considered a 698   leader disappeared 698   overnight.
 601 * it's gotten so quiet.
 603 * there's a bad feeling 698   hanging over 698   everyone.
* like everyone's just 698   going to die here 611 , 698   trapped in the dark...
 602 * ... i bet you're 698   wondering why i'm 698   not the ruler.
 601 * eh.
 601 * i'm not cut out 698   for something like 698   that.
 602 * i like to take it 698   easy 611 , you know?
 602 * ...
 603 * ... that's a joke.
 603 * this is what happens 698   when people like me 698   take it easy.
* ...
 604 * see ya.
 600 * hey 611 , at least things 698   are less crowded.
 601 * 'cause of all the 698   people you killed.
 602 * hope that was a good 698   experience for you.
 603 * ...
 602 * just kidding 611 . 698 * i don't really hope 698   that.
 604 * go to hell.
 603 * it's been a while 611 , 698   huh?
* ...
 601 * it seems a number of 698   important people 698   disappeared overnight.
* but no one else was 698   harmed.
 600 * the people were 698   confused 611 . 698 * it was complete bedlam.
 603 * somehow 611 , at the end of 698   the day...
 601 * a small 611 , white dog 698   became president of 698   the underground.
 600 * it sleeps on the 698   throne and does 698   absolutely nothing.
 601 * strangely 611 , it seems 698   this is the best 698   life for everyone.
 602 * thanks.
 603 * it's been a while 611 , 698   huh?
* ...
 601 * i'll be honest.
 602 * i have no idea what 698   happened for you 698   to get here.
 601 * this is actually some 698   sort of error- 698   handling message.
 603 * so 611 , if you're getting 698   this ending...
 601 * tell whoever made the 698   game 611 , okay?
 602 * they'll fix it 611 , or 698   if it's a novel 698   situation...
 601 * they might even add 698   another ending to 698   the game.
 603 * chances are 611 , though...
 604 * you're just a dirty 698   hacker 611 , aren't you?
 601 * yeah 611 , get outta here.
 601 * H.. 611 . hey.
 600 * So.. 611 . you're the one 698   who killed all my 698   friends.
 601 * I just called to tell 698   you.
 600 * I hate you.
 601 * Yet.. 611 . strangely.. 611 . 698 * It's because of you 611 , 698   that...
 602 * That I was forced to 698   become a better 698   person.
 600 * When I first saw you 698   hurting people...
* I just sat there 611 . 698 * Watching you.
 601 * I felt so guilty knowing 698   I hadn't do anything 698   to stop you.
 603 * I felt like all I 698   do was...
 604 * Was hope you would 698   destroy me 611 , too.
 601 * But when Undyne called 611 , 698   with crazed desperation 698   in her voice...
 600 * I.. 611 . 698 * I realized I had to do 698   something.
 601 * Even if it meant 698   everybody would...
* Have to learn the 698   truth about me.
 602 * It's strange 611 . 698 * You know?
 605 * Even after all the 698   bad things I did.
* People treated me like 698   a hero.
 602 * And then they.. 611 . 698 * Asked me to run 698   everything.
 605 * So I'm trying my 698   best 611 , here.
 602 * I think I have some 698   good policies 611 , but 611 , 698   y-you know...
 601 * Talking to people 698   still makes me 698   nervous.
 600 * I'm no ASGORE 611 , 698   you know?
 602 * ...
 604 * God.. 611 . 698 * I miss everyone.
 603 * Now that they're 698   gone 611 , it...
* It feels so clear what 698   I should have done.
 603 * What I should have 698   said.
 606 * Undyne.. 611 . 698 * Asgore...
* Mettaton...
 605 * At least Sans is 698   still here.
 604 * He's.. 611 . 698 * He's a good guy 611 . 698 * And with him around...
 604 * I...
 602 * Sigh.
 601 * You know 611 . 698 * Just daydreaming here 611 . 698 * But...
 605 * I really should have 698   killed you when I 698   had the chance.

S-s-so if y-y-you 698 c-c-can turn him 698 around... um...
And, umm... press 698 th-th-th-the 698 switch...
He'll be... um... 698 He'll be...
Vulnerable.
Well, g-g-gotta go!

INEFFICIENT.

* IT'S TIME TO FINALLY STOP 698   THE "MALFUNCTIONING" ROBOT.
* ... NOT!!!
* MALFUNCTION? 698 * REPROGRAMMING? 698 * GET REAL.
* THIS WAS ALL JUST A BIG 698   SHOW.
* AN ACT.
* ALPHYS HAS BEEN PLAYING 698   YOU FOR A FOOL THE 698   WHOLE TIME.
* AS SHE WATCHED YOU ON THE 698   SCREEN 611 , SHE GREW ATTACHED 698   TO YOUR ADVENTURE.
* SHE DESPERATELY WANTED TO 698   BE A PART OF IT.
* SO SHE DECIDED TO INSERT 698   HERSELF INTO YOUR STORY.
* SHE REACTIVATED PUZZLES 611 . 698 * SHE DISABLED ELEVATORS 611 . 698 * SHE ENLISTED ME TO TORMENT YOU.
* ALL SO SHE COULD SAVE 698   YOU FROM DANGERS THAT 698   DIDN'T EXIST.
* ALL SO YOU WOULD THINK 698   SHE'S THE GREAT PERSON...
* THAT SHE'S NOT.
* AND NOW 611 , IT'S TIME FOR 698   HER FINEST HOUR.
* AT THIS VERY MOMENT, 698   ALPHYS IS WAITING OUTSIDE 698   THE ROOM.
* DURING OUR "BATTLE," SHE 698   WILL INTERRUPT.
* SHE WILL PRETEND TO 698   "DEACTIVATE" ME, "SAVING" YOU 698   ONE FINAL TIME.
* FINALLY. 698 * SHE'LL BE THE HEROINE OF 698   YOUR ADVENTURE.
* YOU'LL REGARD HER SO HIGHLY 698   SHE'LL EVEN BE ABLE TO 698   CONVINCE YOU NOT TO LEAVE.
* ... OR NOT.
* YOU SEE, I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF 698   THIS PREDICTABLE CHARADE.
* I HAVE NO DESIRE TO HARM 698   HUMANS. 698 * FAR FROM IT, ACTUALLY.
* MY ONLY DESIRE IS TO 698   ENTERTAIN.
* AFTER ALL, THE AUDIENCE 698   DESERVES A GOOD SHOW, 698   DON'T THEY?

* AH HA HA 611 . 698 * EAGER, AS ALWAYS, EH?
* BUT DON'T TOUCH THAT DIAL. 698 * THERE'S SOMETHING YOU 698   HAVEN'T ACCOUNTED FOR.
* AS ANY TRUE FAN WOULD KNOW, 698   I WAS FIRST CREATED AS 698   A HUMAN ERADICATION ROBOT.
* IT WAS ONLY AFTER BECOMING A 698   STAR THAT I WAS GIVEN A 698   MORE... PHOTOGENIC BODY.
* HOWEVER.
* THOSE ORIGINAL FUNCTIONS 698   HAVE NEVER BEEN FULLY 698   REMOVED...

* or something...
* uhhhh.. 611 . 698 * i'm gonna keep working 698   on that mix cd.
* i've almost got a mix cd 698   finished for my scary 698   neighbor...
* it's 74 minutes of people 698   screaming their signature 698   wrestling moves
* but they're all autotuned 611 . 698 * i hope she likes it
* oh..............
* oh.. 611 . a classic spooktune.. 611 . 698 * they don't make songs like 698   this anymore...
* dang.. 611 . that ambience... 698 * it's like my whole body 698   is being spooked...
* oh 611 , this one.. 611 . 698 * once you learn the lyrics 698   it's hard not to sing along...
* ooo ooo ooo 612 o 698 * ooo ooo ooo 612 o 698 * oo oo oo 611 o oo ooo

* human... 611 . 698 * i'll never forget when you 698   cheered me on
* when i was pretending to 698   sleep...
* no one had ever had so 698   much faith in my fake 698   sleep....
* human.. 611 . 698 * i'll never forget...
* that time you tried to 698   destroy me.. 611 . 698 * but... you failed....
* sorry.. 611 . 698 * i messed it up
* uh........ 611 . 698 * also..... 611 . 698 * this is awkward... but
* what's... 611 . 698   your name
* everyone seems to know 698   it now 611 , except me.....
* seems like i've been 698   missing out lately
* i was just sitting at home 698   listening to tunes
* there was a flash of light 698   outside my window
* i saw the snails on the farm 698   disappear
* then i heard a knock at 698   the door
* the flash of light wanted 698   to come in... 698 * i closed the blinds...
* now everyone knows your 698   name except for me
* "frisk..." 698 * ok 611 , i wont forget it
* your name...?
* ...
* "frisk".. 611 . 698 * i didnt forget
* because i cried the 698   letters into my hand
* oh no.. 611 . 698 * the letters in my hand 698   are joining together
* oh no.. 611 . 698 * i'm going to forget your 698   name...
* oh no.. 611 . 698 * i'm trying to cry more 698   tears into my hand...
* oh no.. 611 . 698 * the tears are all forming 698   a big pile...
* oh no.. 611 . 698 * your name's getting really 698   long
* (You still need to recover 698   after all that lying down.)
* awkward.. 611 . 698 * i'm working right now...
* i mean...
* welcome to blook family 698   snail farm...
* ... yeah 611 . 698 * i'm the only employee.
* this place used to get a lot 698   of business...
* but our main customer 698   disappeared one day...
* now it's just some hairy 698   guy that shows up once 698   a month...
* really 611 , i'm working.. 611 . 698 * i don't want the boss 698   to get mad at me...
* especially since i'm my 698   own boss...
* hmmm.. 611 . i should probably 698   try to make friends 698   with my neighbor
* she's kind of scary 611 , but 698   i feel like i'm always 698   too late to make friends...
* i should at least try...
 661  3.. 612 . 698  2.. 612 . 698  1.. 612 .
 661  GO!! 612 !
 661  RACE END!! 612 !
* oh........ 611 . 698 * you both tried your best...
* but the snail looks 698   discouraged...
* her best wasn't good 698   enough...
* oh..........
* oh....... 611 . 698 * looks like you encouraged 698   your snail too much...
* all that pressure to 698   succeed.. 611 . 698 * really got to her...
* oh........
* you won.. 611 . congratulations.
* as a prize 611 , you get 9G.
* sorry.. 611 . we have to make 698   a profit somehow...
* your snail lost by a 698   thin margin.
* actually 611 , the snail is 698   under the false belief 698   that it won...
* oh no.. 611 . the snail is looking 698   over here...
* here 611 , i'll give you some 698   money.. 611 . 698 * act like you won...
* (You got 30G.)
* oh.. 611 . hey.. 611 . you.. 611 .
* followed me.. 611 . 698 * into my house...
* .. 611 . 698 * m-make yourself at home???
* oh.. 611 . 698 * you really came...
* sorry 611 , i... 698 * wasn't expecting that.
* it's not much 611 , but make 698   yourself at home.
* oh.. 611 . are you hungry...
* i can get you something 698   to eat...
* here we go.. 611 . 698 * you'll lie down as long 698   as you don't move.
* so.. 611 . only move around when 698   you want to get up 611 , i 698   guess.
* well 611 , that was nice.. 611 . 698 * thank you...
* oh hey... you... 698 * followed me...
* my house is up here...
* so you probably don't want to 698   come this way...
* hope that helps...
* hey.. 611 . 698 * my house is up here...
* in case you want to see...
* or in case...
* you don't...
* (It's merely a fridge.)
* (It's too dark to see 698   near the walls.)
* Every time this old tree 698   grows any leaves 611 , they fall 698   right off.
* Every time this old tree 698   grows any leaves 611 , they fall 698   right off.
* It's a neat-looking tree.
* (It's natural for a tree to 698   lose its leaves.)
* I don't understand why 698   these aren't selling...
* It's the perfect weather 698   for something cold...
* You must have something better to do than read this message.
* I relocated my store 611 , but 698   there are still no 698   customers...
* You must have something better to do than read this message.
* I thought for sure if I 698   went to Hotland 611 , I'd sell 698   some Nice Creams.
* But nobody wants them 611 . 698 * Everyone's just eating 698   Starfaits and Glamburgers.
* So!!!
* You must have something better to do than read this message.
* I'm so happy! 611 ! 698 * Nice Cream is really 698   changing the world!!
* Hey 611 ! 698 * It's you again 611 !
* Business is excellent here 611 ! 698 * These two fellas bought 698   ALL my ice cream!
* I've actually sold out of 698   everything!!!
* ... sorry.
* Wait 611 ! 698 * I've still got something 698   for you!
* ... a big smile 611 ! 698 * How about that!
* I'm so excited to sell 698   Nice Cream on the surface!
* If all humans are like you 611 , 698   then...!
* ... then I'll still be 698   able to sell to monsters 611 , 698   I hope.
* If all humans are like you 611 , 698   I think it'll be a modest 698   success!
* If all humans are like you 611 , 698   I think it'll be really 698   popular!
* OH!!! 611 ! 698 * A CUSTOMER!!!
* Fortunately 611 , I've thought 698   of a solution!!
* Punch cards!!
* Every time you buy a 698   Nice Cream 611 , you can take a 698   punch card from the box.
* If you have 3 cards 611 , you 698   can trade them for a 698   free Nice Cream!
* They're sure to get the 698   customers to come back!
* Anyway...
* I'm having a going out of 698   business sale.
* You must have something better to do than read this message.
* Oh 611 ? 698 * About that piece I gave you?
* ...
* ... I never gave you anything.
* Ah.. 611 . I can feel that piece 698   of me has been well taken 698   care of.
* Thank you.
* Hmmm... 611 ? 698 * The barrier's opened up?
* Hmmm.. 611 . 698 * Then 611 , if it's not too much 698   to ask...
* ... could you take that 698   piece of me to the surface?
* I would really appreciate 698   it.
* So 611 , did you take that 698   piece of me very far 698   away...?
* ...
* Where's the piece!?
* Ah 611 , the barrier's open...?
* You know I cannot move 611 . 698 * Why are you telling me 611 ? 698 * To mock me?
* Everyone may think you are a 698   good person 611 , but this snowman 698   knows the truth.
* Someday 611 , your friends will 698   realize your heart is as 698   cold as my butt.
* (You're carrying too many 698   items.)
* Hello 611 . 698 * I am a snowman 611 . 698 * I cannot move.
* Traveller 611 , if you could...
* (You got the Snowman Piece.)
* Oh me 611 , oh my 611 . 698 * What are you doing?
* Soon there won't be any 698   of me left...
* (You got the Snowman Piece.)
* Stop.. 611 . 698 * Please...
* (You got the Snowman Piece.)
* (A useless pile of snow.)

* What 611 . 698 * What 611 ? 698 * WHAT!?
* It's a living.
* So 611 , you helped get us 698   all free...
* I guess I really acted 698   like a dummy to you.
* Sorry for acting like a 698   dummy before.
* You've really helped me 698   out!!
* (It's a snail.)
* (For some reason 611 , you can't 698   help but wonder what it 698   tastes like...)
* (It's a snail.)
* (You wonder if Toriel has 698   seen it.)
* We were hanging out 698   when suddenly 611 , a buncha puzzles 698   reactivated out of nowhere.
* This is a huge problem.. 611 . 698 * It rules 611 ! They've GOTTA 698   cancel school over this!
* Wait a second.. 611 . 698 * Auuuugh 611 , it's summer vacation!
* Hey 611 , did you hear 611 ? 698 * The barrier's opened up!
* Now school HAS to be 698   cancelled 611 , right!?
* Why should we bother going 698   to school 611 , anyway...?
* This world's got no future.
* Finally! 698 * Someone turned off that laser!
* Now that we're free we can.. 611 . 698 * Well 611 , uh 611 , I guess we'll just 698   keep standing here.
* Hm 611 ? 698 * Nice try 611 , but your loitering 698   technique still needs work.
* There will be lots of places 698   to loiter on the surface 611 , 698   I bet.
* Loitering around.. 611 . 698 * What's the point?
* The way to work is blocked 611 , 698   so I had time to catch 698   Mettaton's show on my phone...
* The special effects were 698   amazing today 611 ! 698 * That human almost looked REAL!
* Of course 611 , an experienced 698   viewer like me knows CGI 698   when they see it...
* The barrier's opened up 611 , so 698   we don't have to go to 698   work today.
* I mean 611 , sure 611 , we're free 611 , 698   but it's the little 698   things 611 , you know?
* That last episode had me 698   really shaken...
* But Mettaton's OK 611 . 698 * Everyone knows it's just CGI!
* Mettaton 611 ? 698 * Yeah 611 , he's the most popular 698   star in the underground!
* His fan club probably has 698   at least two.. 611 . no 611 , THREE 698   dozen members!
* And that's not even counting 698   me!
* Today 611 , we all started as 698   co-workers...
* Who knows what we'll be 698   tomorrow?
* What a heartbreaker.
* I bet his fanclub's almost 698   doubled in size from that!
* (There's a piece of cheese 698   inside this computerized 698   laser-safe.)
* (The lasers have melted the 698   edges of the cheese.. 611 .) 698 * (It's stuck to the table.)
* (Seems like the mouse hacked 698   the safe and took the 698   cheese out.)
* It's so nice to 698   have you over!
* Why not take a 698   seat at the 698   table?
* Sit at the freakin' 698   table 611 , you little 698   nerd.
* I.. 611 . I.. 611 . I ended up buying a 698   donut...
* I.. 611 . I.. 611 . I didn't want to 611 , but 698   that girl.. 611 . even though I told 698   her no 611 , she...
* ... kept staring at me in this 698   creepy way and licking her 698   lips.
* N.. 611 . now I'm outta cash.
* Maybe I can sell it online 698   and double my money back...
* On the surface 611 , I won't 698   buy any donuts from 698   spiders.
* That's my resolution.

 600 * There you are 611 , 698   Frisk-darling.
 608 * Feast your eyes 611 ! 698 * Dr. Alphys completed 698   my wonderful new body.
 607 * Oooh 611 ! 698 * And did you hear 611 ? 698 * The barrier's OPEN!
 604 * I can't wait to see 698   the sun...
 605 * ... the greatest 698   spotlight of all!!
 609 * Oh yes 611 . 698 * I suppose I should thank 698   you 611 , too 611 , darling.
 602 * Before fighting you 611 , 698   I had...
 604 * Forgotten how fun it 698   was to perform with 698   others.
 606 * So I've been searching 698   for HOT TALENTS to fill 698   up my upcoming troupe.
 600 * So far 611 , Shyren's agreed 698   to be my back-up singer.
 600 * And Bl.. 611 . 698 * Napstablook 611 , here 611 , will 698   be my sound mixer!
 602 * The three of us 698   performing together...
 604 * It really feels overdue 611 , 698   doesn't it?
 600 * Frisk 611 , darling 611 . 698 * Can you help me with 698   something?
 602 * What kind of merchandise 698   do you think humans 698   would want to buy...?
 601 * I've thought of a few 698   ideas so far.
 606 * Buttons (with my face) 698 * Stickers (with my face) 698 * CDs (with my face)
 607 * Posters (with my face) 698 * T-shirts (with my face) 698 * Underwear (with my face)
 609 * ... and plush dolls of 698   TORIEL.
 608 * But, you know 611 . 698 * With my face instead 698   of hers.
 600 * So what do you think?
 628   640   630  
* (...)
* (A yes or no prompt was not 698   provided.)
 628   648   682  
 609 * Fabulous 611 ! 698 * I completely agree!
 602 * Oh 611 , Frisk 611 . 698 * Why don't you go see 698   how Alphys is doing?
 601 * Since the flash of light 698   she's been working hard 698   to set everything right.
 600 * Ha-Ha 611 . 698 * About time 611 , huh?
* (By barking with text-to-speech 698   on 611 , the dog accidentally 698   programmed a whole game.)
* (Hmmm.. 611 . seems fine.)
* Blub blub.. 611 . 698 * You'll have to reserve a 698   table to eat here.
* You'll also need to reserve 698   your chair 611 , your silverware 611 , 698   your food 611 , your...
* Blub blub.. 611 . 698 * Now we can live life 698   without reservations.
* Blub blub.. 611 . 698 * Mettaton isn't here to press 698   his face into the steaks.
* He told me that if he ever 698   disappeared 611 , we could use 698   my face instead...
* But 611 , I'm nervous 611 . 698 * What if my face doesn't 698   taste very good...?
* As I came in 611 , I realized I 698   forgot to make a reservation.
* But I didn't want to look 698   like I messed up 611 . 698 * So I kept walkin' in anyway.
* Now I'm just.. 611 . kinda.. 611 . 698 * Consuming dew off this ficus.
* Oh 611 , we're all free?
* Oh.. 611 . 698 * Guess I can.. 611 . 698 * Stop lickin' this ficus.
* ... but I don't want to look 698   like I messed up 611 , so 698   I'll keep going...
* What would Mettaton think if 698   he saw me licking this 698   plant of his...?
* Eh.. 611 . who cares.
* I work at the CORE 611 . 698 * The inside is a maze made of 698   swappable parts...
* That means we can shuffle the 698   layout at will.
* Boy 611 , was today a FUN day 611 ! 698 * I sure love PUZZLE!!!
* So 611 , if we're leaving 611 , will 698   my job...?
* Ugh 611 , and I just got a raise 611 ! 698 * Well 611 , guess every apple has 698   its CORE 611 , heheh.
* Today 611 , we received the 698   promise of a lot of money 698   from a strange source.
* It may not be kosher 611 , but.. 611 . 698 * Whew 611 ! I love puzzle!
* Originally 611 , we dug mazes 698   with puzzles in order to 698   foil human attacks.
* But now 611 , building things 698   winding and confusing... 611 . 698 * It's some awful tradition.
* You can't go (ugh) two feet 698   without being up to your 698   armpits in puzzles.
* The surface world.. 611 . 698 * Really!
* Maybe I'll be able to 698   go two feet without running 698   into a puzzle.
* One thing I can say...
* I respect Mettaton for not 698   putting any puzzles here.
* At another hotel 611 , I had 698   to find 12 magic keys just to 698   unlock the shower.
* Mettaton looked really.. 611 . 698 * Really cool in that dress.
* It sort of makes me feel like 698   I could wear one 611 , too!
* Mettaton.. 611 .! 698 * He recognized my voice from 698   when I called in 611 , and...
* He.. 611 . he gave me his dress 611 ! 698 * I'm so... 611 ! 698 * Ha ha ha!
* Please don't talk to me 611 . 698 * I am feeling discouraged 698   about something.

* Welcome to MTT Resort 611 ! 698 * Have you seen Mettaton?
* He hasn't come by lately 611 . 698 * I have a lot of respect for 698   that man.
* I had trouble getting a job 698   because I am so pointy and 698   angular.
* But 611 , being a rectangle 611 , he 698   understood my struggles.
* I love hot dogs!
* Hey.. 611 . 698 * Isn't it weird there's 698   SNOW on that guy's roof?
* ... guess he's just too lazy 698   to clean it off.
* I love hot dogs!
* But the hot dog guy left.. 611 . 698 * Even though all of his 698   stuff is still here.
* ... guess he's just too lazy 698   to clean it away.
* I wanted another hot dog 611 . 698 * But the hot dog guy never 698   came back.
* Besides that 611 ? 698 * Today was fine.
* Count your blessings 611 . 698 * Even if you don't get a 698   second hot dog.

WOW! 698 BEING A GOOD HOST 698 IS A REAL WORKOUT!
 603 I CAN'T FEEL MY 698 LEGS...
 600 THAT MUST MEAN 698 I'M BEING A 698 GREAT HOST!!!
TAKE A LOOK 698 AROUND!
SO YOU CAME 698 BACK TO HAVE A 698 DATE WITH ME!
SO YOU CAME 698 BACK TO SEE ME!
 603 YOU MUST BE 698 REALLY SERIOUS 698 ABOUT THIS...
 602 I'LL HAVE TO TAKE 698 YOU SOMEPLACE 698 REALLY SPECIAL...
 600 A PLACE I LIKE 698 TO SPEND A LOT 698 OF TIME!!!
MY HOUSE!!!
MY BROTHER STARTED 698 A SOCK COLLECTION 698 RECENTLY.
 603 HOW SADDENING...
 600 SOMETIMES I WONDER 698 WHAT HE WOULD 698 DO...
WITHOUT SUCH A 698 COOL GUY TAKING 698 CARE OF HIM???
NYEH HEH HEH!
SO 611 , YOU WANT 698 A HINT 611 , HUH?
 603 WELL.. 611 . 698 I'VE BEEN LOOKING 698 AT THE PUZZLE...
AND I THINK THE 698 SOLUTION...
 600 IS TO TURN ALL 698 OF THE X'S INTO 698 O'S!
YOU SHOULD TRY 698 THAT!
ASK AGAIN FOR 698 MORE GREAT HINTS!
 660 MAYBE SOLVING 698 THE  663 LAST PUZZLE 660   698 AGAIN WILL HELP.
ASK AGAIN FOR 698 MORE GREAT HINTS!!
Error, Pepibs.
I ASKED UNDYNE 698 IF WE COULD 698 ALL HANG...
 603 BUT SHE SAID 698 SOMETHING WEIRD.
 600 SHE SAID SHE 698 WON'T HANG OUT 698 WITH A MURDERER.
 603 BUT.. 611 . HMM...
 605 I DON'T REMEMBER 698 MURDERERING 698 ANYONE...
 603 THOUGH I AM A 698 PRETTY BRUTAL 698 KIND OF GUY.
 603 THEN SHE SAID 698 SOMETHING ABOUT 698 WANTING TO...
 601 FIGHT SOME KIND 698 OF BAD GUY.
 603 BUT SHE SEEMS 698 VERY.. 611 . WEAK 698 FROM SOMETHING.
 605 SHE STEPPED OUT 698 AND COLLAPSED IN 698 THE DOORWAY.
 600 SO I'M JUST 698 WAITING HERE IN 698 CASE SHE NEEDS ME.
 603 SINCE SHE HATES 698 BEING WAITED ON 698 HAND AND FOOT.
 605 I THINK WE'LL 698 HAVE TO HANG 698 OUT LATER...
HEY 611 , I...
 605 REALLY DOUBT 698 WE'RE GOING TO 698 BE ABLE TO HANG.
 603 IT'S HARD TO 698 IMAGINE 611 , BUT...
 600 YOU'LL HAVE TO 698 SPEND TIME WITH 698 NOT ME.
HEY 611 ! READY TO 698 HANG OUT WITH 698 UNDYNE???
GREAT!! 611 ! 698 ME TOO!!!
 603 HOWEVER 611 , SHE'S 698 NOT HERE.
 600 NORMALLY SHE 698 RETURNS AT ABOUT 698 THIS TIME.
 603 SHE'S LATE 698 THOUGH...
 603 AND SHE'S NOT 698 ANSWERING HER 698 PHONE.
 600 HOW STRANGE.
I'LL JUST WAIT 698 HERE UNTIL SHE 698 GETS HOME.
I'LL CALL YOU 698 WHEN SHE GETS 698 HERE 611 , OKAY!?
NOPE! 611 ! 698 SHE ISN'T HERE 698 YET!!!
UNDYNE'S HOME 611 , 698 BUT SHE ISN'T 698 FEELING WELL.
 605 I DON'T THINK WE 698 CAN HANG OUT.
 603 IT SEEMS LIKE SHE 698 CAUGHT HEAT-STROKE 698 OR SOMETHING.
SOMEONE MUST HAVE 698 BROUGHT HER 698 BACK HOME...
 605 BECAUSE SHE CAN 698 BARELY MOVE.
 600 BUT SHE IS 698 MUTTERING ABOUT 698 DESTROYING YOU.
SO THAT'S A GOOD 698 VITAL SIGN.
 603 IN ANY CASE 611 , I 698 DON'T THINK WE 698 CAN HANG OUT.
 600 I'M JUST WAITING 698 HERE IN CASE 698 SHE NEEDS ME.
SO 611 , I GUESS YOU 698 CAN RUN ALONG.
UNDYNE IS SICK 611 , 698 SO SHE CAN'T 698 PLAY TODAY.
HEY 611 ! READY TO 698 HANG OUT WITH 698 UNDYNE???
GREAT!! 611 ! 698 BECAUSE SHE'S NOT 698 EVEN HERE.
BEING READY EARLY 611 ! 698 IT SHOWS HOW MUCH 698 YOU CARE!!
 603 EVEN IF SHE'S 698 NOT HERE TO SEE 698 THAT.
NOPE! 611 ! 698 SHE ISN'T HERE 698 YET!!!
HELLO 611 , MY FRIEND.

HELLO.. 611 . 698 H-HOW ARE YOU 611 , 698 MY F-FRIEND?

LET'S HANG OUT 698 WITH UNDYNE 698 LATER.
I'LL CALL YOU 698 WHEN I'M READY!
I'M SO GLAD YOU 698 AND UNDYNE ARE 698 FRIENDS NOW.
YOU TWO GO 698 TOGETHER LIKE 698 PASTA AND BURNING!
OH 611 , HEY...

 601 DON'T COME HERE 698 TO SAY GOODBYE!!
 603 GOODBYES AREN'T 698 ALLOWED IN MY 698 TOWN.
 600 JUST SEE-YOU- 698 LATERS.
IT SEEMS UNDYNE 698 HAS SOMETHING 698 FOR YOU.
SHE'S THE PERSON 698 THAT'S NOT ME.
UNDYNE WRITES A 698 LOT OF LETTERS.
 603 BUT 611 , SHE CAN NEVER 698 SEEM TO FIND THE 698 RIGHT WORDS.
SO WHEN SHE GOES 698 TO DELIVER THEM 698 HERSELF...
SHE ALWAYS QUITS 698 SO SHE CAN GO 698 BACK AND REWRITE.
 600 THAT'S WHY SHE 698 ASKED YOU!!
BECAUSE YOU HAVE 698 NO STANDARDS!!!
ALPHYS SEEMS TO 698 HAVE DISAPPEARED.
DON'T WORRY 611 , THAT'S 698 NORMAL.
YOU SHOULD GO 698 TO HER LAB.
I'M SUPPOSED TO 698 PUT THESE 698 NUMBERS TOGETHER.

* This power has no counter. 698 * Indeed, a human cannot 698   take a monster's SOUL.

 604 BUT YOU AREN'T 698   WORKING!!!
 602 * i know 611 , and it's 698   taking all my 698   concentration.
* you oughta get going 611 . 698 * he might come back 611 . 698 * and if he does...
 602 * ... you'll have to 698   sit through more of 698   my hilarious jokes.
* what's the holdup 611 ? 698 * look 611 , there's nothin 698   to be afraid of.
 602 * it's just a dark cavern 698   filled with skeletons 698   and horrible monsters.
* well?
* ... are you just gonna 698   stare at me 611 , or...?
* grievous error
* over here 611 . 698 * i know a shortcut.
* hey 611 , here's something 698   important to remember.
 660 * my brother has a very 698    664 special attack 660 .
 660 * if you see a  667 blue 698   attack 660 , 611  don't move and 698   it won't hurt you.
* here's an easy way to 698   keep it in mind.
 660 * imagine a stop sign 611 . 698 * when you see a stop 698   sign 611 , you  661 stop 611 , 660  right?
 660 * stop signs are  661 red 660 . 698 * so imagine a  667 blue 660  stop 698   sign instead.
 660 * simple 611 , right 611 ? 698 * when fighting 611 , think 698   about  663 blue stop signs 660 .
* remember.. 611 . 698 * blue stop signs.
* ... hi.
* hey 611 , thanks.. 611 . 698 * my brother seems like 698   he's having fun.
* by the way 611 , did you 698   see that weird outfit 698   he's wearing?
* we made that a few 698   weeks ago for a costume 698   party.
* he hasn't worn anything 698   else since...
* keeps calling it his 698   "battle body."
* man.
 601 * isn't my brother cool?
* it would make my 698   brother happy if you 698   played along.
* thanks for saying 698   "junior jumble" just 698   to appease my brother.
 601 * yesterday he got 698   stumped trying to 698   "solve" the horoscope.
* papyrus.. 611 . 698 * ... finds difficulty in 698   interesting places.
 601 * yesterday he got 698   stumped trying to 698   "solve" the horoscope.
* guess you don't like 698   word searches 611 , huh?
 602 * me neither 611 . 698 * i'm more of a funny 698   pages kind of guy.
 600 * ...
 601 * ...
 601 * i guess despite all 698   that 611 , you still like 698   word searches 611 , huh...?
 600 * that means you can't 698   be all bad.
* actually 611 , that spaghetti 698   from earlier.. 611 .
* it wasn't too bad for 698   my brother.
* since he started cooking 698   lessons 611 , he's been 698   improving a lot.
 601 * i bet if he keeps it 698   up 611 , next year he'll even 698   make something edible.
* hey.. 611 . 698 * puzzles might be fun 611 . 698 * if you tried them.
* good job on solving it 698   so quickly 611 .
* you didn't even need 698   my help.
* which is great 611 , 'cause 698   i love doing absolutely 698   nothing.
* ... you must be really 698   good at puzzles 611 , 698   huh?
* i mean.
* it's impossible for 698   you to have seen 698   this one before.
* hey 611 , why didn't you 698   ask for help?
 601 * i was right here.
* no problem 611 , huh?
* what's up?
* you sure do like to 698   exercise.
* i don't know what my 698   brother's going to do 698   now.

 601 * seems like you're 698   gonna fight my brother 698   pretty soon.
 602 * here's some friendly 698   advice.
 603 * if you keep going the 698   way you are now...
* ...
 604 * you're gonna have a 698   bad time.
 600 * dang 611 , i wish i brought 698   a parasol.
 601 * i'm getting a nasty burn 698   from all this sun.
* grievous error
* let's hang out again 698   sometime.
 603 * hey 611 , i really 698   respect what you did 698   back there.
 602 * thanks.
* over here 611 . 698 * i know a shortcut.
* Skipped ahead.
what 611 ? 698 you think i'm just 698 gonna stand there 698 and take it?
our reports showed 698 a massive anomaly 698 in the timespace 698 continuum.
timelines jumping 698 left and right, 698 stopping and 698 starting...
 604 until suddenly 611 , 698 everything ends.
 604 heh heh heh...
 605 that's your fault 611 , 698 isn't it?
 601 you can't understand 698 how this feels.
 604 knowing that one 698 day 611 , without any 698 warning...
 609 it's all going to 698 be reset.
 609 look 611 . 698 i gave up trying 698 to go back a long 698 time ago.
 604 and getting to the 698 surface doesn't 698 really appeal 698 anymore 611 , either.
 604 cause even if we 698 do...
 605 we'll just end up 698 right back here 611 , 698 without any memory 698 of it 611 , right?
 601 to be blunt...
 604 it makes it kind 698 of hard to give 698 it my all.
 601 ... or is that just 698 a poor excuse for 698 being lazy...?
 603 hell if i know.
 604 all i know is.. 611 . 698 seeing what comes 698 next...
 609 i can't afford not 698 to care anymore.
 609 ugh.. 611 . 698 that being said...
 601 you 611 , uh 611 , really 698 like swinging that 698 thing around 611 , 698 huh?
 600 ...
 604 listen.
i know you didn't 698 answer me before 611 , 698 but...
 604 somewhere in 698 there 611 . 698 i can feel it.
 600 there's a glimmer 698 of a good person 698 inside of you.
 604 the memory of 698 someone who once 698 wanted to do the 698 right thing.
 601 someone who 611 , in 698 another time 611 , 698 might have even 698 been...
 604 a friend?
 603 c'mon 611 , buddy.
 600 do you remember 698 me?
 604 please 611 , if you're 698 listening...
 609 let's forget all 698 this 611 , ok?
 603 just lay down 698 your weapon 611 , and...
 604 well 611 , my job 698 will be a lot 698 easier.
 609 ugh.. 611 . 698 that being said...
 601 you 611 , uh 611 , really 698 like swinging that 698 thing around 611 , 698 huh?
 600 ...
 604 listen.
friendship...
 603 it's really great 611 , 698 right?
let's quit fighting.
 603 welp 611 , it was 698 worth a shot.
 605 guess you like 698 doing things the 698 hard way 611 , huh?
 603 woah 611 , you look 698 REALLY pissed off...
 604 heheheh...
 605 did i getcha?
 604 well 611 , if you came 698 back anyway...
 601 i guess that means 698 we never really 698 WERE friends 611 , huh?
 604 heh.
 609 don't tell that 698 to the other 698 sans-es 611 , ok?
 604 sounds strange 611 , but 698 before all this i 698 was secretly hoping 698 we could be friends.
 601 i always thought the 698 anomaly was doing 698 this cause they 698 were unhappy.
and when they got 698 what they wanted 611 , 698 they would stop 698 all this.
 603 and maybe all they 698 needed was.. 611 . 698 i dunno.
 651 some good food 611 , 698 some bad laughs 611 , 698 some nice friends.
 604 but that's 698 ridiculous 611 , 698 right?
 605 yeah 611 , you're the 698 type of person 698 who won't EVER 698 be happy.
 605 you'll keep 698 consuming timelines 698 over and over 611 , 698 until...
 604 well.
 651 hey.
 603 take it from me 611 , 698 kid.
someday...
you gotta learn 698 when to QUIT.

 603 and that day's 698 TODAY.
 604 cause.. 611 . 698 y'see..
 601 all this fighting 698 is really tiring 698 me out.
 604 and if you keep 698 pushing me...
 662 t 603 hen i'll be 698 forced to use my 661   698 special attack 662 .
 662 y 603 eah 611 , my  661 special 698 attack 662 . 698 sound familiar?
 662 w 601 ell 611 , get ready 611 . 698 cause after the 698 next move 611 , i'm 698 going to  661 use it 662 .
 603 so 611 , if you don't 698 wanna see it 611 , now 698 would be a good 698 time to die.
 604 well 611 , here goes 698 nothing...
 603 are you ready?
 662 s 605 urvive THIS 611 , and 698 i'll show you my 661   698 special attack 662 !
...
you're sparing me?
 601 finally.
 603 buddy 611 . 698 pal.
 604 i know how hard 698 it must be...
to make that 698 choice.
to go back on 698 everything you've 698 worked up to.
 600 i want you to 698 know.. 611 . 698 i won't let it 698 go to waste.
 651 ...
 603 c'mere 611 , pal.
* Just keep attacking.
* Sans's movements grow a 698   little wearier.
* Sans's movements seem to be 698   slower.
* Felt like a turning point.
* You felt your sins crawling 698   on your back.
* You felt your sins weighing 698   on your neck.
* KARMA coursing through your 698   veins.
* Doomed to death of KARMA!
* The REAL battle finally begins.
* Reading this doesn't seem 698   like the best use of time.
* Sans is starting to look 698   really tired.
* Sans is preparing something.
* Sans is getting ready to 698   use his special attack.
* Sans is sparing you.
* SANS 1 ATK 1 DEF 698 * The easiest enemy 611 . 698 * Can only deal 1 damage.
* Can't keep dodging forever 611 . 698 * Keep attacking.
* SANS 1 ATK 1 DEF 698 * The easiest enemy 611 . 698 * Can only deal 1 damage.
it's a beautiful 698 day outside.
birds are singing 611 , 698 flowers are 698 blooming...
on days like these 611 , 698 kids like you...
it's a beautiful 698 day outside.
birds are singing 611 ,
ready?
Should 698 be 698 burning 698 in hell.
 601 huh.
 651 always wondered why 698 people never use 698 their strongest 698 attack first.
 603 anyway 611 , as i was 698 saying 611 , it's a 698 nice day out.
 651 why not relax and 698 take a load off?
here we go.
* You feel like you're going to 698   have a bad time.
huff.. 611 . puff...
all right 611 . 698 that's it.
 662 i 651 t's time for my 661   698 special attack 662 .
 603 are you ready?
 604 here goes nothing.
 601 yep.
 601 that's right.
 603 it's literally 698 nothing.
 601 and it's not gonna 698 be anything 611 , 698 either.
 604 heh heh heh.. 611 . 698 ya get it?
 601 i know i can't 698 beat you.
 604 one of your turns...
 609 you're just gonna 698 kill me.
 601 so 611 , uh.
 604 i've decided...
it's not gonna BE 698 your turn 611 . 698 ever.
 603 i'm just gonna 698 keep having MY 698 turn until you 698 give up.
 605 even if it means 698 we have to stand 698 here until the 698 end of time.
 601 capiche?
 609 you'll get bored 698 here.
 601 if you haven't 698 gotten bored 698 already 611 , i mean.
 605 and then 611 , you'll 698 finally quit.
 605 i know your type.
 601 you're 611 , uh 611 , very 698 determined 611 , aren't 698 you?
 604 you'll never give 698 up 611 , even if 698 there's 611 , uh...
 603 absolutely NO 698 benefit to 698 persevering 698 whatsoever.
 601 if i can make 698 that clear.
 604 no matter what 611 , 698 you'll just keep 698 going.
 609 not out of any 698 desire for good 698 or evil...
 603 but just because 698 you think you 698 can.
 601 and because you 698 "can"...
 609 ... you "have to."
 609 but now 611 , you've 698 reached the end.
 604 there is nothing 698 left for you now.
 601 so 611 , uh 611 , in my 698 personal opinion...
 603 the most 698 "determined" 698 thing you can 698 do here?
 601 is to 611 , uh 611 , 698 completely give 698 up.
 603 and.. 611 . (yawn) 698 do literally 698 anything else.
heh 611 , didja 698 really think you 698 would be able to
...
...
...
so...
guess that's it 611 , 698 huh?
...
just...
don't say i 698 didn't warn you.
welp.
i'm going to 698 grillby's.
papyrus 611 , do you 698 want anything?
* actually 611 , hey.. 611 . 698 * hate to bother ya 611 , but 698   can you do me a favor?
* i was thinking.. 611 . 698 * my brother's been 698   kind of down lately...
* he's never seen a human 698   before 611 . and seeing you 698   might just make his day.
* don't worry 611 , he's not 698   dangerous.
 601 * even if he tries to be.
 600 * thanks a million 611 . 698 * i'll be up ahead.
 600 * well 611 , i'll be straight- 698   forward with you.
 601 * my brother'd really 698   like to see a human...
 602 * so 611 , y'know 611 , it'd 698   really help me out...
 601 * if you kept pretending 698   to be one.
* It's some sort of checkpoint 698   or sentry-station.
* But there are bottles of 698   ketchup 611 , mustard 611 , and relish 698   sitting inside...
* well 611 , here we are.
* so.
* your journey's 698   almost over 611 , huh?
 600 * you must really 698   wanna go home.
 601 * hey 611 . 698 * i know the feeling 611 , 698   buddo.
 600 * though...
 601 * maybe sometimes it's 698   better to take what's 698   given to you.
 600 * down here you've 698   already got food 611 , 698   drink 611 , friends...
* is what you have 698   to do...
 601 * really worth it?
* ...
 601 * ah 611 , forget it.
 600 * i'm rootin' for 698   ya 611 , kid.
* hey.
 601 * let me tell you 698   a story.
 600 * so i'm a sentry in 698   snowdin forest 611 , right?
* i sit out there 698   and watch for humans 611 . 698 * it's kind of boring.
 602 * fortunately 611 , deep in 698   the forest...
 600 * there's this HUGE 698   locked door.
* and it's perfect 698   for practicing 698   knock knock jokes.
* so one day 611 , i'm 698   knocking 'em out 611 , 698   like usual.
* i knock on the 698   door and say 698   "knock knock."
* and suddenly 611 , from 698   the other side...
 601 * i hear a woman's 698   voice.
 684 * 600  "who is there?" 
 629 * 601  so 611 , naturally 611 , I 698   respond:
 600 * "dishes."
 684 * "dishes who?"
 629 * 602  "dishes a very 698   bad joke."
 600 * then she just 698   howls with laughter.
 601 * like it's the best 698   joke she's heard 698   in a hundred years.
 600 * so I keep 'em 698   coming 611 , and she keeps 698   laughing.
 601 * she's the best 698   audience i've ever 698   had.
 600 * then 611 , after a 698   dozen of 'em 611 , 698   SHE knocks and says...
 684 * "Knock knock!"
 629 *  601 i say "whos 698   there?"
 684 *  600 "old lady!"
 629 * 601  "old lady who?"
 684 * 602  "oh! I did not 698   know you could 698   yodel!"
 629 * 601  wow.
 602 * needless to say 611 , 698   this woman was 698   extremely good.
 600 * we kept telling 698   each other jokes 698   for hours.
 600 * eventually 611 , i had 698   to leave.
 602 * papyrus gets kind 698   of cranky without 698   his bedtime story.
 600 * but she told me 698   to come by again 611 , 698   and so i did.
 600 * then i did again 611 . 698 * and again 611 . 698 * it's a thing now.
* telling bad jokes 698   through the door.
 601 * it rules.
* ...
 600 * one day 611 , though 611 , i 698   noticed she wasn't 698   laughing very much.
* i asked her what 698   was up.
* then she told me 698   something strange.
*  684 "if a human ever 698   comes through this 698   door..."
* "... could you please 611 , 698   please promise 698   something?"
* "watch over them 611 , 698   and protect them 611 , 698   will you not?"
 600 * 629  now 611 , i hate making 698   promises.
 601 * and this woman 611 , 698   i don't even know 698   her name.
 603 * but...
 601 * someone who sincerely 698   likes bad jokes...
 602 * has an integrity 698   you can't say 698   "no" to.
 601 * do you get what 698   i'm saying?
 600 * that promise i made 698   to her...
 601 * you know what would 698   have happened if she 698   hadn't said anything?
 603 * ... buddy.
* ... You'd be dead 698   where you stand.
 603 * ...
 601 * hey 611 , lighten up 611 , 698   bucko!
 602 * i'm just joking 698   with you.
 601 * besides...
 600 * haven't i done a 698   great job protecting 698   you?
* i mean 611 , look at 698   yourself.
 602 * you haven't died 698   a single time.
 600 * that's right 611 , isn't 698   it?
 602 * well 611 , chalk it 698   up to my great 698   skills.
 600 * hey 611 , what's that 698   look supposed to 698   mean?
 601 * am i wrong...?
* heh.
* well 611 , that's all.
 601 * take care of 698   yourself 611 , kid.
 600 * 'cause someone really 698   cares about you.
* (The door is locked.)
* (You unlock the door and 698   enter...)
* (It's a mailbox overflowing 698   with unread junk mail.)
* (It's a lump of snow with the 698   word 'sans' written on it 698   in red marker.)
* Seems like someone was 698   walking in circles just 698   to make noises...
 661 *  621  left.
 661 * That comedian...
* Determination.
* The comedian got away 611 . 698 * Failure.
 661 *  621  left.
* Determination.
 661 *  621  left.
* Determination.
* Determination.

 600 * Hello 611 , traveller 611 . 698 * How can I help you?*

 600 What would 698 you like 698 to buy?*
 605 Thanks for 698 your 698 purchase.*
 600 Just 698 looking?*
 606 That's not 698 enough 698 money.*
 606 You're 698 carrying 698 too much.*
*
 600 Care to 698 chat?*
 603 * Huh 611 ? 698 * Sell somethin' 611 ? 698 * Does this look like a 698   pawn shop?
 604 * I don't know how it works where 698   you come from... but...
 600 * If I started spending money 698   on old branches and used 698   bandages 611 , I'd be out of business 698   in a jiffy!
 604 * If you're really hurtin' for 698   cash 611 , then maybe you could 698   do some crowdfunding.
* I hear people will pay for 698   ANYTHING nowadays.
* You took 758G from behind the 698   counter.
* Nothing left.
 600 * Bye now 611 ! 698 * Come again sometime!
* ...
 600 * Hiya 611 ! Welcome to Snowdin 611 ! 698 * I can't remember the last 698   time I saw a fresh face around 698   here.
 604 * Where did you come from 611 ? 698 * The capital?
 600 * You don't look like a tourist 611 . 698 * Are you here by yourself?
 600 * I mean 611 , it happened to you 611 , 698   right?
* There was a strange flash of 698   white light.. 611 . 698 * Then I felt my body being pulled 698   into.. 611 . something.
* Then 611 , suddenly 611 , everything was 698   back to normal.
 600 * You want to know what to do 698   here in Snowdin?
 604 * Grillby's has food 611 , and the 698   library has information...
* If you're tired 611 , you can take 698   a nap at the inn 611 . 698 * It's right next door  611 - my sister 698   runs it.
 600 * And if you're bored 611 , you can 698   sit outside and watch those wacky 698   skeletons do their thing.
 600 * There's two of 'em.. 611 . 698 * 604  Brothers 611 , I think 611 . 698 * They just showed up one day 698   and.. 611 . 698 * 600  ... asserted themselves.
* The town has gotten a lot 698   more interesting since then.
 600 * I heard that it was all 'cause 698   a human came through here.
* A human.. 611 . 698 * I can hardly believe it!
* Well if they decide to stop 698   in 611 , I'll be sure to give 698   them a hero's welcome.
 604 * Think back to your history 698   class...
 600 * A long time ago 611 , monsters lived 698   in the RUINS back there in 698   the forest.
* Long story short 611 , we all decided 698   to leave the ruins and head 698   for the end of the caverns.
* Along the way 611 , some fuzzy folk 698   decided they liked the cold 698   and set up camp in Snowdin.
 606 * Oh 611 , and don't think about 698   trying to explore the RUINS...
 600 * The door's been locked for 698   ages 611 . 698 * So unless you're a ghost 698   or can burrow under the door 611 , 698   forget about it.
 600 * Didja hear 611 ? 698 * The RUINS have been opened up 611 , 698   and get this...
* They were opened from the 698   INSIDE.
* Apparently the Queen had been 698   staying inside there for God 698   knows how long.
* Pretty unbelievable 611 , huh!?
 600 * Life is the same as usual.
 601 * A little claustrophobic...
 602 * But.. 611 . we all know deep down 698   that freedom is coming 611 , don't we?
 602 * As long as we got that hope 611 , we 698   can grit our teeth and face the 698   same struggles 611 , day after day...
 605 * That's life 611 , ain't it?
 600 * Well 611 , I suppose I'll move 698   my store to the overworld...
* ... haven't planned much 698   more than that 611 , I'm afraid.
* (There's a note here.)
* Please don't hurt my family.
* Don't be shy now.*
* Woah there 611 ! 698 * I've got some neat 698   junk for sale.*
* Wah ha ha 611 ! 698 * I knew you could 698   do it!*
* Wa ha ha.. 611 . 698 * So you came here 611 . 698 * What a treat!*
What are 698 you lookin 698 for?*
Thanks! 698 Wa ha ha.*
Careful 698 with that.*
You're 698 a bit 698 short 698 on cash.*
You're 698 carrying 698 too much!*
Don't 698 expect a 698 discount.*
Here we 698 are.*
...*
Eh 611 ? 698 You can't 698 afford 698 it?*
Don't you 698 have 698 enough?*
Anything 698 you 698 wanna 698 know?*
Really? 698 YOU 698 wanna 698 chat?*
 602 * Ha 611 ! 600   698 * I'm tryin' to get RID of 698   my junk 611 , not get more of it!
 604 * Though 611 , I've heard if you 698   want to sell stuff 611 , the Temmie 698   Village is your best bet.
 600 * Where is it?
 603 * ...
 600 * I don't remember.
* For the last time 611 , I'm not 698   taking it!
* I hear people will pay for 698   ANYTHING nowadays.
 603 * I wouldn't buy your chitzy 698   garbage at knifepoint.
* Be careful out there 611 , kid!
* Good riddance.
* I've been around a long time 611 . 698 * 603  Maybe too long.
 602 * Studying history sure is 698   easy when you've lived through 698   so much of it yourself 611 ! 698 * 600  Wa ha ha!
 600 * Long ago 611 , ASGORE and I 698   agreed that escaping would 698   be pointless...
 603 * Since once we left 611 , humans 698   would just kill us.
 601 * I felt a little betrayed when 698   he eventually changed his 698   mind.
 604 * But now 611 , I think.. 611 . 698 * Maybe he was right to.
 602 * 'Cause after all 611 , even though 698   we never escaped...
 603 * A human's killing us anyway 611 , 698   ain't that right?
* OK 611 , OK 611 ! 698 * I remember it clearly now.
 603 * It was the monthly address at 698   the castle 611 , and the queen 698   was giving her part on 698   current events.
 600 * After finishing her update 611 , 698   she moved to pass the 698   microphone to the king.
 603 * However 611 , she didn't realize 698   the microphone was still in 698   her hands when she said:
 602 * "Your turn 611 , Fluffybuns."
 600 * The audience burst into 698   laughter.
 602 * Realizing what she had said 611 , 698   she started laughing too.
 600 * After a few moments 611 , the 698   king held up his arms 611 . 698 * The crowd grew silent.
 603 * He leaned towards the 698   microphone 611 , expression.. 611 . 698 * Stern.
 600 * "Dear citizens. 611 " 698 * "Thank you for coming 698   here today."
 603 * "I.. 611 . King Fluffybuns..."
 602 * And the rest is history.
 602 * What's that 611 ? 698 * You want me to repeat myself?
 600 * Heck no 611 ! 698 * Your eyes still work.. 611 . 698 * Go read a book or something 611 ! 698 * Wahaha!
 600 * Oh yeah.. 611 . 698 * The prophecy.
 604 * Legend has it, an 'angel' who has 698   seen the surface will descend 698   from above and bring us freedom.
 603 * Lately 611 , the people have been 698   taking a bleaker outlook...
 604 * Callin' that winged circle the 698   'Angel of Death.'
 603 * A harbinger of destruction 611 , 698   waitin' to 'free' us from 698   this mortal realm...
* In my opinion 611 , when I see 698   that little circle...
 602 * I jus' think it looks neat 611 ! 698 * Wahaha!
 600 * That emblem actually predates 698   written history 611 . 698 * The original meaning has been 698   lost to time...
 604 * All we know is that the 698   triangles symbolize us monsters 698   below 611 , and the winged circle 698   above symbolizes...
 603 * Somethin' else.
 600 * Most people say it's the 698   'angel 611 ,' from the prophecy...
 600 * Eh 611 ? 698 * You don't know what that is?
 601 * What are they teaching you 698   kids in school nowadays... 611 ? 698 * 602  Wa ha ha!
 660 * 600  That's the  663 Delta Rune 611 , 660  the 698   emblem of our kingdom 611 . 698 * The Kingdom...
* ... of Monsters.
* Wahaha 611 ! 698 * Great name 611 , huh 611 ? 698 * It's as I always say...
* Ol' King Fluffybuns can't name 698   for beans!
 603 * Eh 611 ? 698 * Goat?
 602 * Actually 611 , that reminds me 611 . 698 * Toriel once wore a flower- 698   patterned muu-muu... 
 600 * Folks kept saying "nice muu- 698   muu" to her 611 , but she kept 698   thinking they were calling 698   her a cow.
 601 * So she never wore it again.
 603 * What was the question again?
 600 * Oh 611 . 698 * Right 611 . 698 * ASGORE.
 603 * He's a real interesting 698   type of monster 611 . 698 * The strongest type of all.
 600 * We call 'em Boss Monsters.
* When they have an offspring 611 , 698   the SOUL power of the 698   parents flows into the 698   child...
* Causing the child to grow 698   as the parents age.
 603 * But ASGORE doesn't have a 698   child 611 . 698 * So he's been stuck at the 698   same age.. 611 . 698 * And probably will be forever.
 601 * Huh 611 ? 698 * What if the child is a 698   human... 611 ? What?
 601 * Nah 611 . That wouldn't work 611 . 698 * So if ASGORE's your father 611 , 698   he'll definitely outlive 698   you.
 601 * I've lived too long to 698   be afraid of something 698   like you.
 602 * Try it 611 , kiddo!
 603 * ... I know you can't here.
 601 * Wah ha.. 611 . 698 * Knowledge like that is 698   the only reason I've 698   survived so long.
* King Fluffybuns 611 ? 698 * He's a friendly 611 , happy-go-lucky 698   kind of guy...
 604 * If you keep walking around long 698   enough 611 , you'll probably meet him 611 . 698 * 600  He loves to walk around and 698   talk to people.
 603 * Eh 611 ? 698 * Why do I call Dreemurr 698   'Fluffybuns? 611 ' 698 * 602  Oh 611 , that's a great story!
 603 * ...
 600 * I don't remember it.
* But if you come back much 698   later 611 , I'm sure I'll have 698   remembered by then.
 602 * Oh yeah 611 ! 698 * Of course 611 . 698 * Toriel was queen 611 , and 698   Asgore was the king.
 603 * It was tragic when she left.
 601 * Since everyone knew she was 698   really the brains behind the 698   throne...
 600 * But it was also just a 698   teensy 611 , teensy bit relieving 611 , 698   you know?
 603 * Those two were really 698   insufferable together.. 611 . 698 * Nuzzling noses 611 , bein' all cute 698   n' cuddly in public.. 611 . 698 * Embarrassing their children...
 600 * They were so sweet it 698   made me SICK 611 . 698 * Thank god those days are 698   over!
 603 * Eh 611 ? Fight you?
 601 * Nah.. 611 . I'm not a hero 611 . 698 * Never was.
 602 * And b'sides.. 611 . 698 * These old bones aren't fit 698   for fighting anyhoo.
 603 * One attack from you 611 , and 698   then I'd... well...
 602 * At least by talking to 698   you 611 , I've bought enough time 698   for some of them to escape.
 600 * Undyne 611 ? 698 * Yeah 611 , she's a local hero 698   around here.
 604 * Through grit and determination 698   alone 611 , she fought her way to 698   the top of the Royal Guard.
 603 * Actually 611 , she just came through 698   here asking about someone who 698   looked just like you...
 600 * I'd watch your back 611 , kid 611 . 698 * And buy some items.. 611 . 698 * It might just save your hide 611 ! 698 * Wa ha ha!
 600 * Undyne 611 . 698 * She's really come a long way 698   since she was a little 698   urchin.
 602 * I used to be a hero myself 611 , 698   back in the old days 611 . 698 * Gerson 611 , the Hammer of Justice.
 603 * When she was younger 611 , Undyne 698   would follow me around 611 , to 698   watch me beat up bad guys...
 600 * Sometimes she'd even try 698   to help!
 603 * Though 611 , most of the time 698   the folks she attacked weren't 698   bad guys 611 . 698 * It'd be the mailman or 698   something like that.
 602 * Anyhoo 611 , I appreciated it 611 ! 698 * Wah ha ha ha!!!
 601 * I'm not a hero.
 603 * But I know there's someone 698   out there.
 600 * Someone who'll never give 698   up trying to do the 698   right thing 611 , no matter 698   what.
 604 * There's no prophecy or 698   legend 'bout anyone like 698   that.
 603 * It's just something I know 698   is true.
 600 * That someone like that 698   will strike you down.
* Don't be shy now.*
* Hey 611 ! 698 * Check it 698   out!*
* But 611 , like.*
* Yeah! 698 * Check it 698   out!*
* Nobody 698   came and 698   stuff.*
 600 You should 698 buy ALL 698 our stuff!*
 604 Bratty! 698 We're 698 gonna 698 be rich!*
 600 So are 698 you gonna 698 buy it??*
 600 You need 698 WAY more 698 money.*
 600 You have 698 TOO many 698 items!!!*
 604 We're all 698 $$$$$old 698 out! 698 Mee-YOW!*
*
So, like, 698 what's up?*
* Thanks 611 , but we 611 , 698   like 611 , don't 698   really need 698   anything.*
 652 * Oh my God 611 . 698 * Is that a 698   glamburger?*
* Stole 5G 698   from the 698   till.
* The till 698   is empty.
* Like 611 , see 698   you later!*
* Like 611 , later 698   and stuff!*
* ...*
* ...*
* I'm Bratty 611 , and 698   this is my 698   best friend 611 , 698   Catty.*
* I'm Catty 611 , and 698   this is my 698   best friend 611 , 698   Bratty.*
 653 * Well 611 , that kind 698   of guy...
 655 * You hang out 698   with him once 611 , 698   then he wants 698   to hang out...
 652 * All 611 . 698 * The 611 . 698 * Time.
 655 * Oh 611 , uh...*
 654 * OK 611 , like 611 , 698   the annoying 698   thing is...*
 652 * Oh 611 , that guy 698   from the 698   store 611 ? 698 * 654  Yuck 611 , what a 698   creep.*
 650 * So 611 , we're 698   like 611 , 698   totally 698   free now 611 , 698   huh?*
* Where do we 698   get the 698   garbage?
 654 * Like 611 , the 698   garbage store 611 , 698   duh!!!
* I mean 611 , like 611 , 698   where does 698   anyone get guns 611 , 698   or food 611 , or...*
* The stuff 698   inside 611 , is 698   like...*
 652 * Oh 611 , oops 611 , 698   really?
 653 * Uh 611 , well 611 , 698   when we 698   said 611 , um...
* We were 698   hyped for the 698   destruction 698   of humanity...
* We were 611 , 698   just 611 , like 611 , 698   joking 611 , you 698   know?
* So 611 , like 611 , 698   Dr. Alphys 698   built Mettaton 611 , 698   right?*
 656 * Oh my God 611 . 698 * Mettaton.
 656 * He's like.. 611 . 698 * My robot 698   husband.          
 654 * I think we're 698   like.. 611 . both 698   going to marry 698   him.*
 602 * Oh my GOD 611 , 698 * METTATON.
 602 * Actually he's 698   like.. 611 . 698 * MY robot 698   husband.
* We're both 698   like 611 , ALREADY 698   married to 698   him.*
 606 * He just 611 , like 611 , 698   doesn't know 698   it yet.
* Hmmm.. 611 . 698 * Now that 698   we're 698   gonna be 698   free...*
 655 * Oh my God 611 . 698 * Alphys.
 650 * She used to 698   live on our 698   street.*
 607 * Oh my god 611 , 698 * ALPHYS.
 600 * She was like 698   a big sister.*
 650 * So Alphys 698   has always 611 , 698   like...*
 654 * Oh my God 611 . 698 * He's a total 698   goober.
 650 * Like 611 , I LOVE 698   that guy.
 655 * God 611 , we're 698   like...
 651 * SO hyped for 698   the destruction 698   of humanity.*
 600 * He's a big 611 , 698   fuzzy 698   goofball!!   
 600 * He's like 611 , 698   SO nice.  
 607 * God 611 , we're 698   like...
 601 * SO hyped for 698   the destruction 698   of humanity.*
 650 * Me 611 ? 698 * Yeah 611 , I 698   LOVE cats!
 651 * They're 611 , 698   like 611 , 698   SO tasty!!*
 608 * Me 611 ? 698 * Yeah 611 , I 698   LOVE cats!
 601 * They're 611 , 698   like 611 , 698   SO cute!!!*
* Hey 611 , this is 698   Bratty!*
* Hey 611 , this is 698   Catty!*
 603 * TOTALLY wicked 698   expensive.
* But 611 , like 611 , this 698   stuff we found 698   is like...*
 603 * TOTALLY wicked 698   cheap.
 655 * You should...
 651 * TOTALLY wicked 698   buy all of 698   it?*
 607 * Like...      
 604 * TOTALLY wicked 698   buy all of 698   it?*
 601 * We found it in 698   the garbage!
 653 * It's GOOD 698   garbage.*
 604 * It's like 611 , 698   really good 698   garbage.
 655 * .....
 651 * Waterfall 698   mostly.*
 607 * .....
 601 * I found a gun 698   in a dumpster!
 606 * That's like 611 , 698   what they 698   TELL you.
 652 * But like.. 611 . 698 * Mettaton always 698   acts like...*
 605 * ... being built 698   was HIS 698   idea somehow.
 655 * And even right 698   after he was 698   built...*
 607 * ... he acted 698   like Alphys was 698   an old friend.
 654 * But they're 698   like.. 611 . 698 * Not friends 698   anymore.*
 601 * Yeah!! 611 ! 698 * Unlike me 698   and Bratty! 611 ! 698 * Best friends 698   for-EVER!!!
 654 * I mean 611 , like 611 , 698   if your big 698   sister...*
 601 * Takes you on 698   trips to the 698   dump.
 650 * She showed us 698   the coolest 698   places to 698   find trash.*
 607 * She was always 698   collecting 698   these weird 698   cartoons.
 655 * Then she 698   became the 698   Royal 698   Scientist...*
 605 * Yeah 611 , we 698   haven't seen 698   her in 698   forever...
 602 * Thought ASGORE 698   is a SUPER 698   cutie.
 654 * So 611 , like 611 , I'm 698   pretty sure 698   she...*
 600 * Made Mettaton 698   to 611 , like 611 , 698   totally 698   impress him.
 652 * A robot with a 698   SOUL...*
 605 * That's 611 , like 611 , 698   SUPER relevant 698   to his hobbies!
 650 * So after seeing 698   Mettaton 611 , 698   ASGORE...*
 600 * Asked her to do 698   all this science 698   stuff for him!
 605 * But nobody's 611 , 698   like 611 , seen 698   anything from 698   her yet.
 652 * Or... 698   her at all...*
 600 * She must 611 , 698   like 611 , just 698   stay in her 698   lab all day.
 654 * Like 611 , live 698   a little 611 , 698   girl.*
 601 * Yeah!! 611 ! 698 * Like us!!!
 604 * Oh my god 611 , 698   can you go 698   get us some 698   Glamburgers?
 650 * We don't. 698 * Really need 611 . 698 * Anything.*
 602 * Wait 611 ! I'll pay 698   you 1000G if 698   you get Mettaton 698   to autograph 698   my butt!
 604 * OH MY GOD!! 611 ! 698 * GIMME!!!
 654 * God 611 , Catty. 698 * Try to have 698   some 698   self-control.*
 605 * Sorry...
 656 * 'Cause they 698   OBVIOUSLY 698   brought that 698   Glamburger 698   for ME.*
 601 * NOOO WAYYY!!!!!
 605 * Yeah 611 ! He's 698   a creep!
 607 * But he's kind 698   of cute 611 , 698   too...
 654 * C'mon 611 , 698   Catty 611 , don't 698   you have 698   ANY 698   standards 612 ?*
 601 * 651  Nope!!!
 607 * He'd be OK 698   if he just 698   treated us 698   with some 698   respect.
 655 * But he just 698   acts.. 611 . 698 * Really 698   weird.*
 605 * And then acts 698   like it's OUR 698   fault he 698   acts that 698   way!
 650 * Like 611 , when 698   we asked him 698   to get those 698   Glamburgers...*
 600 * He dropped them 698   and ran away 698   before we 698   could even say 698   anything!
 653 * We were 611 , 698   like 611 , going 698   to share 698   them.*
 607 * Really 611 ? 698 * I wasn't.
 651 * Catty!!
 601 * 652  Yeah! 611 ! 698 * He should come 698   look for 698   junk with us!
 653 * But like 611 , if 698   we let him 698   hang out with 698   us.. 611 . I just 698   worry it'll...*
 604 * 652  ... be really 698   super fun!
 651 * Um 611 , that was 698   NOT what I 698   was gonna say.*
 601 * But I was 698   close 611 , right!?
 607 * But don't you 698   feel bad for 698   him 611 , Bratty?
 605 * Poor 698   Burgerpants...
 604 * Think about how 698   cool we are 698   compared to 698   him!!!
* We'd be saving 698   his LIFE with 698   our 698   friendship!!
 601 * His LIFE 611 , 698   Bratty!!
 654 * Uh 611 , so?
 607 * .. 615 . 
 601 * Think of all 698   the glamburgers 698   he could get 698   for us!!*
 653 * ... so is he 698   free after 698   work?
 600 * Yeah 611 , like 611 , 698   totally 698   free.
* Like.. 611 . 698 * Cool.*
 600 * Yeah 611 , like 611 , 698   cool.
* Like 611 , 698   millennia 698   of being 698   imprisoned 698   finally over?*
 600 * Yeah 611 , that's 698   like pretty 698   chill I guess.
 607 * Did we say 698   that?
 654 * Probably?
 651 * It's 611 , like 611 , 698   practically 698   our 698   catchphrase.
 608 * Really 611 ? 698 * I thought our 698   catchphrase 698   was...
 604 * B-B-Bratty's 698   the best 611 , 698   C-C-Catty's 698   the coolest!
 651 * Um 611 , no?
* We've like 698   literally 698   NEVER said 698   that.
 601 * CAN it be 698   though! 611 ? 698 * CAN it be!?
 604 * OMG 611 , we 698   can finally 698   fulfill our 698   DREAM of having 698   a pet cat!
 651 * That's 611 , like 611 , 698   YOUR dream 611 , 698   Catty.*
* But Bratty...
 605 * 655  I don't wanna 698   have a dream 698   without YOU 698   in it...!
* Aww.. 611 . 698 * Catty.. 613 .*
 601 * And 611 , in my 698   dream 611 , YOU clean 698   up after 698   the cat!
 651 * Catty!!!
 605 * Bratty 698   NOOOO!!!
 651 * I'm just 698   kidding!!
 654 * 608  Kind of.
 655 * 607  Anyway 611 , when 698   was the last 698   time you even 698   SAW a cat 698   around here?
 608 * Oh! 611 ! 698 * JUST the other 698   day!
 603 * There was 698   this CUTE 698   little white 698   cat walking 698   around...
 604 * It was 611 , like 611 , 698   SOOOOOO 698   clueless 698   looking.
 601 * I pet it 698   for like an 698   hour!!
 655 * .... 611 . 698 * .... 611 . 698 * ... Catty 612 .*
 607 * Yeah 611 , Bratty?
 651 * I think that 698   was 611 , like.. 611 . 698 * A dog 613 .*
 601 * DOGS ARE JUST 698   FIRM CATS!!!!
* If you're 698   reading 698   this...*

 607 * Yeah 611 ! 698 * Chill 611 , Alphys! 698 * We don't wanna 698   waste pens!
* And don't even 698   THINK about 698   stealing our 698   stuff.*

* Catty 611 , it's 698   not JUNK 611 . 698 * It's really 698   valuable.*
* Yeah 611 ! 698 * Our garbage 698   is REALLY 698   valuable!
* Anyway 611 . 698 * In closing 611 : 698 * You're a 698   total loser!*

 603 * WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE.
 606 * Hmmm.. 611 . 698 * Why not try selling that to 698   the two chicks in the alley?
 603 * Ah 611 . Yes 611 . 698 * I really want to buy your 698   weird dusty artifacts.. 611 . 698 * NOT.
 602 * Have a SPARKULAR day!
 606 * Any time 611 , little buddy.
 606 * Alone again...
 606 * I'm getting on in years 611 , so 698   let me give you some 698   advice 611 , little buddy.
 603 * You've still got time 611 . 698 * Don't live like me.
 606 * I'm 19 years old and I've 698   already wasted my entire life.
 600 * So we're free 611 , huh 611 ? 698 * Mettaton told us as much.
 604 * Then he told me 611 , "don't 698   think that means you're 698   getting out of work early."
 606 * Ah.. 611 . my boss. 698 * I love that guy.
 603 * And by that I mean I hate 698   him so 611 , so much.
 601 * Evacuation 611 ? 698 * You're yanking my chain 611 , 698   little weirdo.
 603 * So WHAT if everybody else 698   left work? 698 * So WHAT if nobody's buying 698   anything?
 606 * Par for the course 611 , 698   little weirdo 611 . 698 * Par for the course.
* I'm a goofy goober Yeah  698   this errorr. message.
 606 * Thank you 611 , little buddy.
 605 * They wanna hang out after 698   work?
 603 * Ha 611 ! Ahahaha! 611 ! Yes!! 611 ! 698 * I won't let you down!!
 606 * Little buddy.. 611 . thank you.
* You've brought a tear to the 698   eye of this old man.
 605 * So 611 , uh 611 , where do they 698   want to go?
 604 * ...
* They want to hang out at 698   the garbage dump.
* ...
 606 * Well 611 , nowhere to go but 698   up 611 , right 611 , little buddy?
 606 * Hey little buddy 611 , wanna help 698   me pick a spicy outfit for 698   my little shindig later?
 604 * Though 611 , now that I think 698   about it 611 , I had to throw away 698   all of my clothes to make 698   room for the outfits Mettaton 698   gave me...
 605 * Don't take it the wrong way 611 . 698 * They're just all these...
 604 * Weird getups.
 601 * "Promotional" costumes 611 . 698 * For "holidays. 611 " 698 * Or "specials. 611 " 698 * Or "because he felt like it."
 603 * The thing IS though 611 ! 698 * Most of the time I'm the 698   only employee who has to 698   wear this stuff!
 603 * Sometimes he even calls me 698   into his office just to.. 611 . 698 * Make me put something on...
 604 * Then he laughs and lets me 698   go back to work as normal.
 606 * Anyways 611 , I won't sweat it 611 , 698   little buddy 611 . 698 * I'll take it casual.
* NEVER let hot people think 698   you care 611 . 698 * That's how they GET you.
 605 * Well 611 ? 698 * Don't keep me waiting 611 , 698   little buddy!!
 604 * The girls were.. 611 . 698 * Talking about me...?
* They say I should stop acting 698   like they owe me...
 605 * ... and if I want to be 698   FRIENDS with them 611 , I should 698   just.. 611 . uh 611 , try to see 698   things from their 698   perspective?
 604 * Wow.
 606 * Poor 611 , naive little buddy 611 . 698 * They've brainwashed you.
* "Friendship" is just a hot 698   person's way of making you 698   their slave.
 604 * ...
 605 * So 611 , uh 611 , what time would 698   they wanna hang out?
 605 * Huh 611 ? 698 * Yeah 611 , those two vendors in back 611 . 698 * The girls.
 603 * NOT the Nice Cream guy.
 605 * He keeps coming in here and 698   asking me stuff like 611 , 698 * "Hey Burgy, what do you think 698   of this joke for my next 698   ice cream wrapper?"
 604 * Joke 611 ? 698 * Why are you calling it a JOKE?
 603 * You drew a picture of two 698   dudes hugging and wrote 698   "I love hugs!" on it.
 603 * You somehow understand comedy 698   EVEN LESS than that guy who 698   keeps going on stage and 698   crying about his family.
 605 * Anyway 611 , I 611 , uh 611 , just tell him 698   that they're good 611 , because he 698   gives me the nice cream for 698   free afterward...
 604 * Everyone calls me burgerpants 698   now.
 605 * But you won't 611 , will you 611 , 698   little buddy?
 606 * So I went out to the alley 698   to see those two ladies 611 , and 698   uh.. 611 . you know 611 , see what'd 698   happen next.
 604 * ...
 605 * Then my boss 611 , uh 611 , saw me and 698   asked me what I was doing.
 601 * I was so startled 611 , the hamburgers 698   in my pockets tumbled out 698   onto the ground.
 603 * Not wanting to lose face 611 , 698   I scrambled to pick them up!
 603 * But 611 , as I was leaning over 611 , 698   the weight of the remaining 698   hamburgers...
 605 * ... caused my pants to fall 698   down.
 604 * Then the girls laughed at me.
 604 * Everyone calls me Burgerpants 698   now.

 606 * Listen 611 . 698 * I like you 611 , little buddy 611 . 698 * So I'm gonna save you a lot 698   of trouble.
 603 * Never interact with attractive 698   people.
 606 * Unless you're "one of them 611 ," 698   they're just gonna take 698   advantage of you.
 603 * Like that time those two 698   chicks asked me to sneak them 698   some glamburgers.
 606 * And I 611 , naive teenager that 698   I was 611 , said yes to them.
 604 * Bad idea.
 604 * Those girls? 698 * The ones who saw my pants 698   fall down?
 605 * Well 611 , we're all gonna be 698   free 611 , so I'll never see 698   them again 611 , at least!
 604 * So we're free now.
 605 * Does that mean my double- 698   date is cancelled...?
 604 * ...
 605 * I know 611 , it wasn't really 698   a.. 611 . 698 * A date.
 606 * Here's a trick 611 , little buddy 611 : 698 * Lie to yourself all the time 611 . 698 * It makes you feel better.
 604 * Well 611 , Mettaton didn't tell me 698   I HAD to work, I guess...
 603 * But that's the thing 611 ! 698 * Sometimes he doesn't even 698   call me into work until 698   halfway into my shift!
 604 * If I don't play it safe 611 , 698   he's going to yell at me.
 606 * Okay 611 , maybe "yell" is the 698   wrong term.
 604 * It's more like he has this.. 611 . 698 * CD album he plays...
 605 * That's entirely full of 698   songs about how bad I am 698   at my job.
 605 * Let's not talk about this.
 601 * Why do people find him so 698   attractive??
 603 * He's literally just a freaking 698   rectangle.
 604 * ...
* You know 611 , one time 611 , I bought 698   one of those 611 , uh 611 , kits 698   online.. 611 . to...
 605 * Uh 611 , make yourself more 698   rectangular.
 604 * ...
 605 * They don't work.
 603 * God 611 , have you even looked 698   around 611 ? 698 * This place is a labyrinth of 698   bad choices.
* And every time we try to change 698   something for the better 611 , he 698   vetoes it and says "that's not 698   how they do it on the 698   surface."
 601 Oh! Right!
 603 * Humans are always eating 698   hamburgers made of SEQUINS 698   AND GLUE.
 605 * When I first came to Hotland 611 , 698   it was my dream to work 698   with Mettaton.
 604 * ...
 603 * Well 611 , be careful what you 698   wish for 611 , little buddy!
 603 * Don't tell anyone this 611 , Little 698   Buddy.
 604 * (Because they'll make fun 698   of me,)
 605 * But I.. 611 . 698 * I feel like I played a hand in 698   everyone getting free 698   somehow.
 601 * Even if it was just 698   working this awful job...
 605 * I think I did something!
 603 * I don't know if it's true 611 , 698   but I'll believe it anyway!
 603 * Huh? 698 * Everyone else is DEAD?
 604 * ...
 605 * Does that mean I don't 698   have to work today?
 606 * God 611 . 698 * That it were true 611 , 698   little weirdo 611 . 698 * That it were true.
 603 * Future 611 ? 698 * WHAT future 611 ? 698 * Nothing down here EVER 698   changes.
 604 * I'll probably be trapped 698   at this stupid job forever.
* ...
 603 * But wait 611 ! 698 * There's one thing that keeps 698   me going!
* If ASGORE gets just one 698   more SOUL 611 , we'll finally get 698   to go to the surface!
* It'll be a brand new world 611 ! 698 * There's gotta be a second 698   chance out there for me 611 ! 698 * For everyone!
 606 * So stay strong 611 , little buddy 611 . 698 * When I make it big 611 , I'll 698   keep you in mind.
 603 * Little buddy 611 ! 698 * There's a brand new world 698   out there waiting 698   for us.
 606 * I'm sure with my (ahem) 698   qualifications 611 , it won't 698   be long before I'm a 698   famous movie star...
 604 * Or 611 , maybe I'll just end up 698   flipping burgers again.
 603 * But it's as I say 611 ! 698 * Nowhere to go but up 611 ! 698 * Literally 611 , in this case!
 606 * Sorry 611 , little weirdo 611 . 698 * Threats won't work on me.
* I can't go to hell 611 . 698 * I'm all out of vacation 698   days.
 600 * I'm sorry 611 , (Ha ha) it's against 698   the rules to talk to customers 698   who haven't bought anything.
 601 * What 611 ? 698 * Why do you keep trying to talk 698   to me?
 601 * I'll get in trouble if I get 698   chummy with the customers.
 600 * Sorry.
 604 * ...
 603 * SO 611 , I wanted to be an ACTOR.

 601 ?????
 605 I just said I'm 698 not interested in 698 the offer!!
 605 ...

 605 Look, stranger
 604 I... I guess I'm 698 going to have to 698 tell the truth.
My whole life, I've 698 never been worth a 698 lot of EXP.
Everyone else at my 698 work, in my classes,
Would raise a 698 person's LV by 4 698 or 5 when 698 destroyed...
 601 But me?
 606 I wouldn't even 698 increase your LV 698 at LV 1.

I've never been 698 very good at 698 getting killed. 698 So...
 603 I'm flattered 698 that you... 698 Want to destroy me.
 608 But you are making 698 a big waste of 698 your time!!
 608 Stop killing me!!!

 601 You trying to 698 kill me... 698 C... 698 could it be...?
 606 Because you 698 don't like me 698 very much...?
 602 No, no, that 698 can't be!
This is just a 698 friendly, um, 698 killing between 698 acquaintances!!!
 608 Pals... we're... 698 we're still pals, 698 right!!
 601 OK, maybe not 698 PALS, but, uh,
 602 Friendly strangers?
 608 You know, just 698 one step away from 698 being buds!!!

 602 Pull out some 698 baguettes and some 698 swiss cheese!
 608 BLOW ON A FREAKING 698 PARTY HORN!!!
 601 N... no, you don't 698 like me either, 698 huh...?
 604 Nobody likes me... 698 they're just putting 698 up with me
 606 I'm just annoying 698 you... I should just 698 leave
 601 ARRRRRGHHHH!!! 698 Why am I such an 698 idiot??!?!!!!
How did I not 698 see it before!!!
 601 You weren't killing 698 me because you 698 LIKED me!!!
 606 NOBODY does that!
 That's NOT a thing!
 602 Oh. Sorry. I was 698 being too loud. 698 Ugh.
 604 I'm wasting your 698 time, aren't I...?
 609 ...
 601 ... whew, I feel 698 really... 698 strange.
 602 I think I need to 698 go home and lie 698 down.
 601 Oh, I'm so sorry! 698 How clumsy of me... 698 I've bumped into you
 606 I'm such a klutz.
I was just here to 698 find something to 698 draw, and...
 602 Oh no, it's ok! 698 It's OK!
 600 I'll give you a 698 gift to make up 698 for your troubles.
 600 Let me look in 698 my vest!
 606 Ummm, I couldn't 698 find anything I 698 want to give away.
 602 Wait, wait!
 654 I've got my notebook!
 600 I can draw you a 698 picture in it!
 607 I'm quite the artist, 698 you know.
 608 I'll draw you a 698 GREAT picture!!!
 606 S.. sorry... 698 The drawing didn't 698 come out very well.
 602 Wait 611 ! 698 I know the problem!
 650 I just have to 698 find a better piece 698 of paper for it!
 606 None of my papers 698 are good enough to 698 use...
 602 IT'S OK!!!
 608 I know what I 698 can do! 611 ! 698 I'll use my magic 698 pencil!
 600 It has to be under 698 some of these papers 698 somewhere!!!!
 601 AHHHHH!!!
 655 H 608 ere! 698 I got it!
My magic pencil is 698 amazing!
 602 Everything I draw 698 with it looks...
 608 COMPLETELY REAL!
 601 I've messed up. 698 I've really messed up. 698 Oh no.
 602 I'll just use a 698 regular pencil! 698 I'll try my best!
 608 Are you ready!?
 600 I just finished.
 656 Here's your picture! 698 What do you think!?
 602 It's a representation 698 of your deepest 698 essence...
 607 It's great 611 , right!?
...
 608 (They think my art 698 is terrible.)
 650 Well!
 602 I'll leave you with 698 that thought!
 607 Goodbye!
 608 See you later!
 602 Sayonara!
 601 Nice knowing ya!
 607 Hasta la vista.
 609 ...
 602 I should leave.

What is it, 698 deary?
...
No, no, it's 698 time to go~
... 698 well... maybe 698 ONE little 698 nibble~~
Just kidding, 698 of course~
If you don't mind 698 being gobbled up~ 698 Ahuhuhu~
Ahuhuhuhu~ 698 Well, I don't 698 mind keeping 698 you here~
Feeling comfortable 698 trapped in that 698 web?
It's time to go~
Ahuhuhu~ 698 What are you 698 doing~

Why so pale? 698 You should be proud~
Proud that you're 698 going to make a 698 delicious cake~ 698 Ahuhuhu~
Let you go 611 ? 698 Don't be silly~
Your SOUL is going 698 to make every spider 698 very happy~~~
You're scaring off 698 all my customers!
Oh, how rude of me! 698 I almost forgot 698 to introduce you 698 to my pet~
It's breakfast time, 698 isn't it? 698 Have fun, you two~ 
The person who warned 698 us about you...
Offered us a LOT of 698 money for your SOUL.
Looked like a total 698 nerd.
They had such a sweet 698 smile~ and... ahuhu~
She was very 698 adamant I run away 698 with her~~~ 698 Ahuhuhu~~~
It's strange, but 698 I swore I saw them 698 in the shadows... 698 Changing shape...?
She even left a 698 route for me to 698 escape from~
Oh, it's lunch time, 698 isn't it? 698 And I forgot to 698 feed my pet~
With that money, 698 the spider clans 698 can finally be 698 reunited~
She said she would 698 block off the rest 698 of Hotland after I 698 followed her~
You haven't heard? 698 Spiders have been 698 trapped in the RUINS 698 for generations!
Foolish nerd~ 698 A spider NEVER leaves 698 her web~
(Except to sell 698 pastries~)
Even if they go 698 under the door, 698 Snowdin's fatal cold 698 is impassable alone.
Ah 611 , but I do feel 698 a little regret 698 over it now...
But with the money 698 from your SOUL, we'll 698 be able to rent 698 them a heated limo~
Yes 611 , I should have 698 wrapped her up when 698 I had the chance~
And with all of 698 the leftovers... 611 ? 698 We could have a 698 nice vacation~
Or even build a 698 spider baseball 698 field~
She looked like she 698 would have made a 698 juicy donut~~~
But enough of that... 698 It's time for 698 dinner, isn't it? 698 Ahuhuhu~
Don't look so 698 blue 611 , my deary~
* Muffet pours you a cup of 698   spiders.
* All the spiders clap along to 698   the music.
* Muffet does a synchronized 698   dance with the other spiders.
* Muffet tidies up the web 698   around you.
* Smells like freshly baked 698   cobwebs.
* MUFFET - ATK 38.8 DEF 18.8 698 * If she invites you to her 698   parlor 611 , excuse yourself.
* You struggle to escape the web 611 . 698 * Nothing happened.

* You struggle to escape the web 611 . 698 * Muffet laughs and claps 698   her hands.
* You struggle to escape the web.
* Muffet is so amused by your 698   antics that she gives you a 698   discount!
* You struggle to escape the web 611 . 698 * Nothing happened.
* You pay  621 G 611 . 698 * Muffet reduces her ATTACK 698   for this turn!
* You empty your pockets 611 , but you 698   don't have enough money. 698 * Muffet lowers the price.
* You're out of money 611 . 698 * Muffet shakes her head.
* You empty your pockets.. 611 . 698 * But you don't have any 698   money at all!
* Muffet takes pity on you 698   and reduces her ATTACK for 698   this turn.
* Muffet refuses your money.
... I think purple is 698 a better look on 698 you! Ahuhuhu~
* You're trapped in a strange 698   purple web!
You're still alive 611 ? 698 Ahuhuhu~
Oh, my pet~ 698 Looks like it's 698 time for dessert~
Huh 611 ? 698 Where did you get 698 that...?
Did you steal it?
Oh 611 , my pet 611 ~ 698 It's time to show 698 them what we do 698 with thieves~
Huh? 698 A telegram from 698 the spiders in 698 the RUINS?
What? 698 They're saying 698 that they saw 698 you, and...
... that this is 698 an error message!?
... even if you 698 are stingy, you 698 never hurt a 698 single spider!
... even if you 698 hurt others, you 698 never hurt a 698 single spider!
... you helped donate 698 to their cause!
... you were 698 really passionate 698 about spiders!
... you're a total 698 spider fanatic!
They say even if 698 you are a hyper- 698 violent murderer...
You never laid a 698 single finger on a 698 spider!
Oh my, this has 698 all been a big 698 misunderstanding~
I thought you 698 were someone that 698 hated spiders~
The person who 698 asked for that SOUL...
They must have 698 meant a DIFFERENT 698 human in a 698 striped shirt~
The person who 698 warned me about 698 you...
They really had 698 no idea what they 698 were talking about~
Sorry for all the 698 trouble~ 698 Ahuhuhu~
I'll make it up 698 to you~
You can come back 698 here any time... 698 And, for no charge 698 at all...
I'll wrap you 698 up and let you 698 play with my pet 698 again!
Ahuhuhuhuhuhu~ 698 Just kidding~
I'll SPARE you 698 now~
* Muffet is sparing you.
* Welcome to our parlor 611 , dearie 611 ~ 698 * Interested in some spider 698   pastries?
* All proceeds go to real 698   spiders~
* Check out the webs to 698   make a purchase~
* Ahuhuhuhu...
* Did you hear what they 698   just said?
* Did you hear what she 698   said?
* They said a human wearing a 698   striped shirt will come 698   through.
* I heard that they hate 698   spiders.
* I heard that they love to 698   stomp on them.
* I heard that they hate 698   everybody.
* I heard that they like to 698   tear their legs off.
* I heard...
* However...
* And even if they gave us 698   money 611 , I heard...
* ... that they're awfully 698   stingy with their money.
* ... a certain stingy human 698   hates spiders.
* Ahuhuhuhu...
* You think your taste 698   is too refined for our 698   pastries 611 , don't you 611 , deary?
* Ahuhuhu.. 611 . 698 * I disagree with that 698   notion.
* I think your taste...
* Is exactly what this 698   next batch needs!
* ... that can't be true 611 , 698   can it?
* Ahuhuhu...
* You donated so much money 698   to us.
* All the spiders want you 698   to know how thankful 698   they are!
* We're in your debt 611 , dearie~
* ... that they have some awful 698   taste.
* What a shame 611 . 698 * A human comes through and they 698   aren't even fit to be eaten~
* Oh well 611 ! 698 * Rotten ingredients can 698   always be discarded~
* Ahuhuhuhu...
* That was fun 611 ! 698 * See you again 611 , dearie!
* (It's a tough-looking branch.) 698 * (It's too heavy to pick up.)
* (It's been smashed like it 698   was nothing...)
A long time ago, 698 a human fell 698 into the RUINS.*
Injured by its 698 fall, the human 698 called out for 698 help.
ASRIEL 611 , the king's 698 son 611 , heard the 698 human's call.*
He brought the 698 human back to 698 the castle.
Over time 611 , ASRIEL 698 and the human 698 became like 698 siblings.*
The King and 698 Queen treated the 698 human child as 698 their own.*
The underground 698 was full of 698 hope.
Then.. 611 . 698 One day...*
The human became 698 very ill.
The sick human 698 had only one 698 request.*
To see the 698 flowers from 698 their village.*
But there was 698 nothing we could 698 do.
The next day.*
The next day.
...*
The human died.
ASRIEL 611 , wracked 698 with grief 611 , 698 absorbed the 698 human's SOUL.*
He transformed 698 into a being 698 with incredible 698 power.
With the human 698 SOUL 611 , ASRIEL 698 crossed through 698 the barrier.*
He carried the 698 human's body 698 into the sunset.*
Back to the 698 village of the 698 humans.
ASRIEL reached 698 the center of 698 the village.*
There 611 , he 698 found a bed of 698 golden flowers.*
He carried 698 the human 698 onto it.
Suddenly 611 , screams 698 rang out.*
The villagers 698 saw ASRIEL 698 holding the 698 human's body.*
They thought 698 that he had 698 killed the 698 child.
The humans 698 attacked him 698 with everything 698 they had.*
He was struck 698 with blow after 698 blow.*
ASRIEL had the 698 power to destroy 698 them all.
But...*
ASRIEL did not 698 fight back.
Clutching the 698 human...*
ASRIEL smiled 611 , 698 and walked away.
Wounded 611 , ASRIEL 698 stumbled home.*
He entered the 698 castle and 698 collapsed.*
His dust spread 698 across the 698 garden.
The kingdom fell 698 into despair.*
The king and 698 queen had lost 698 two children 698 in one night.*
The humans had 698 once again taken 698 everything 698 from us.
The king decided 698 it was time to 698 end our 698 suffering.*
Every human who 698 falls down here 698 must die.*
With enough souls 611 , 698 we can shatter 698 the barrier 698 forever.
It's not long 698 now.
King ASGORE 698 will let us 698 go.   *
King ASGORE 698 will give us 698 hope.*
King ASGORE 698 will save us 698 all. 
You should be 698 smiling 611 , too.*
Aren't 698 you 698 excited?*
Aren't 698 you 698 happy?
You're going 698 to be free.
 600 Howdy 611 ,  620 !
You finally made 698 it home.
 600 Remember when we 698 used to play here?
 600 Hee hee hee...
Boy!
 609 Today's gonna be 698 just as fun.
 601 I remember when I 698 first woke up here 611 , 698 in the garden.
I was so scared.
 602 I couldn't feel my 698 arms or my legs...
 601 My entire body had 698 turned into a 698 flower!
 605 "Mom 611 ! Dad 611 ! 698 Somebody help me 611 !" 698 I called out.
 609 But nobody came.
 601 Eventually 611 , the king 698 found me 611 , crying in 698 the garden.
I explained what had 698 happened to him.
Then he held me 611 , 698  620 .
He held me with 698 tears in his eyes 611 , 698 saying...
"There 611 , there 611 . 698 Everything is going 698 to be alright."
He was so.. 611 . 698 Emotional.
 601 But.. 611 . 698 For some reason...
 601 I didn't feel 698 anything at all.
 601 I soon realized I 698 didn't feel ANYTHING 698 about ANYONE.
My compassion had 698 disappeared!
 607 And believe me 611 , 698 it's not like I 698 wasn't trying.
 603 I wasted weeks with 698 that stupid king 611 , 698 vainly hoping I would 698 feel something.
 601 But it became too 698 much for me.
I ran away from 698 home.
Eventually 611 , I reached 698 the RUINS.
 600 Inside I found HER 611 , 698  620 .
I thought of all 698 people 611 , SHE could 698 make me feel whole 698 again.
 601 ...
 607 She failed.
 606 Ha ha...
 601 I realized those two 698 were useless.
I became despondent.
I just wanted to 698 love someone.
I just wanted to 698 care about someone.
 620  611 , you might 698 not believe this...
 602 But I decided.. 611 . 698 It wasn't worth 698 living anymore.
 607 Not in a world 698 without love.
 606 Not in a world 698 without you.
 601 So...
 600 I decided to follow 698 in your footsteps.
 601 I would erase myself 698 from existence.
 601 And you know what?
 600 I succeeded.
 601 But as I left this 698 mortal coil...
I started to feel 698 apprehensive.
 609 If you don't have 698 a SOUL 611 , what happens 698 when you...?
 601 Something primal 698 started to burn 698 inside me.
"No 611 ," I thought 611 . 698 "I don't want to 698 die!"
...
Then I woke up.
Like it was all 698 just a bad dream.
I was back at the 698 garden.
 600 Back at my 698 "save point."
Interested 611 , I decided 698 to experiment.
Again and again 611 , I 698 brought myself to 698 the edge of death.
At any point 611 , I 698 could have let this 698 world continue on 698 without me.
But as long as I 698 was determined to 698 live...
 600 I could go back.
 606 Amazing 611 , isn't it 611 , 698  620 ?
 600 I was amazed 611 , too.
 601 At first 611 , I used my 698 powers for good.
 600 I became "friends" 698 with everyone.
I solved all their 698 problems flawlessly.
Their companionship 698 was amusing...
 601 For a while. 
 601 As time repeated 611 , 698 people proved 698 themselves 698 predictable.
What would this 698 person say if I 698 gave them this?
What would they do 698 if I said this to 698 them?
Once you know the 698 answer 611 , that's it.
That's all they are.
 601 It all started 698 because I was 698 curious.
 600 Curious what would 698 happen if I killed 698 them.
 602 "I don't like this 611 ," 698 I told myself.
 601 "I'm just doing this 698 because I HAVE to 698 know what happens.
 608 Ha ha ha.. 611 . 698 What an excuse!
 609 You of all people 698 must know how 698 liberating it is to 698 act this way.
 608 At least we're better 698 than those sickos 698 that stand around and 698 WATCH it happen...
 609 Those pathetic people 698 that want to see it 611 , 698 but are too weak to 698 do it themselves.
 600 I bet someone like 698 that's watching right 698 now 611 , aren't they...?
 601 Nowadays 611 , even that's 698 grown tiring.
 607 You understand 611 , 698  620 .
 606 I've done everything 698 this world has to 698 offer.
 601 I've read every book 611 . 698 I've burned every 698 book.
I've won every game 611 . 698 I've lost every game.
I've appeased 698 everyone 611 . 698 I've killed everyone.
Sets of numbers.. 611 . 698 Lines of dialogue.. 611 . 698 I've seen them all.
 601 But you.. 611 . 698 YOU'RE different.
 600 I never could 698 predict YOU 611 ,  620 .
 601 When I saw you in 698 the RUINS 611 , I didn't 698 recognize you.
 608 I thought I could 698 frighten you 611 , then 698 steal your SOUL.
 601 I failed.
 600 And when I tried 698 to load my save 698 file...
 601 It didn't work.
 609  620 .. 611 . 698 Your DETERMINATION!
 608 Somehow 611 , it's even 698 greater than mine!
 601 I just have one 698 question for you 611 , 698  620 .
How did you get 698 back to the RUINS 698 from here...?
 600 ... wait 611 , I know.
She must have taken 698 you when she left.
 601 And decided to give 698 you a proper burial 611 , 698 rather than...
 600 Hanging out in the 698 basement forever.
 601 ... but 611 , why then...?
What made you wake 698 up?
 606 Did you hear me 698 calling you...?
 601 It doesn't matter 698 now.
 601 I'm so tired of 698 this 611 ,  620 .
I'm tired of all 698 these people.
I'm tired of all 698 these places.
I'm tired of being 698 a flower.
 620 .
 600 There's just one 698 thing left I want 698 to do.
Let's finish what we 698 started.
Let's free everyone.
 608 Then.. 611 . let's let 698 them see what 698 humanity is 698 REALLY like!
 606 That despite it all...
 609 This world is still 698 "kill or be killed!!"
 601 Then...?
 607 Well 611 . 698 I had...
 609 Been entertaining a 698 few ways to use 698 that power.
 608 Hee hee hee...
 601 ...
 601 But seeing you here 698 changed my mind.
 606  620 .. 611 . 698 I think if you're 698 around...
 607 Just living in the 698 surface world 698 doesn't seem so bad.
 600 We don't even need 698 to leave to get 698 them this time.
The king has six of 698 them locked away.
 601 I've tried hundreds 698 of ways to get him 698 to show me them...
 603 But he just won't.
 601  620 ...
 600 I know he'll do it 698 for YOU.
 600 Why am I telling 698 you all of this?
 606  620  611 , I said it 698 before.
 601 Even after all this 698 time...
 600 You're still the 698 only one that 698 understands me.
 608 You won't give me 698 any worthless pity!
 609 Creatures like us...
 600 Wouldn't hesitate to 698 KILL each other if 698 we got in each 698 other's way.
 600 So that's...
 601 So.. 611 . that's.. 611 . 698 Why...
 602 ...
 602 ... ha.. 611 . 698 Ha...
 606 ... what's this.. 611 . 698 ... feeling?
Why am I.. 611 . 698 Shaking?
...
Hey.. 611 .  620 .. 611 . 698 No hard feelings about 698 back then 611 , right?
...
 604 H-Hey 611 , what are you 698 doing!?
B.. 611 . back off!!
I.. 611 . I've changed 698 my mind about all 698 this.
This isn't a good 698 idea anymore.
Y-you should go back 611 , 698  620 .
 600 This place is fine 698 the way it is!
...
 604 S-s-stop making that 698 creepy face!

 652 But 611 , accepting 698 that it's all 698 over...
But there WILL be 698 more 611 , will there 698 not?
 651 Maybe.
 652 Knowing the 698 answer is...

Aren't you 698 supposed 698 to be dying or 698 something?
Well 611 . 698 What is the point 698 of that now?
What will you do 698 instead...?
Hmmm 611 . 698 Perhaps I will 698 bake another pie.
That last one ended 698 up a little burnt.
 602 I thought it was 698 good.
 601 Theoretically.
 604 It's not like I 698 ate it all while 698 you were 698 fighting.
Hey 611 ! Hey 611 ! 698 Can I have some 698 pie!
You are just going 698 to eat it all...

 What are 698  you 698  doing?
 Attack 698  or run 698  away!

 Fight me 698  or 698  leave!
 Stop it.

 Go away!
 ...
 ... 698  ...
I know you want 698 to go home 611 , but...
But please... go 698 upstairs now.
I promise I will 698 take good care 698 of you here.
I know we do not 698 have much 611 , but...
We can have a 698 good life here.
Why are you 698 making this so 698 difficult?
Please 611 , go upstairs.
.....
Ha ha...
Pathetic 611 , is it not 612 ? 698 I cannot save even 698 a single child.
...
No 611 , I understand.
You would just be 698 unhappy trapped 698 down here.
The RUINS are very 698 small once you 698 get used to them.
It would not be 698 right for you to 698 grow up in a 698 place like this.
My expectations... 698 My loneliness... 698 My fear...
For you 611 , my child... 698 I will put them aside.
 600 Urgh...
 600 You are stronger 698 than I thought...
Listen to me 611 , 698  small one...
If you go beyond 698 this door,
Keep walking as 698 far as you can.
Eventually you will 698 reach an exit.
 601 .. 611 . 698 ....
 661 ASGORE 662 .. 611 . 698 Do not let  661 ASGORE 662   698 take your soul.
His plan 698 cannot be allowed 698 to succeed.
 602 ......
Be good 611 , 698 won't you?
 603 My child.      
Y... you... 698 really hate me 698 that much?
Now I see who I 698 was protecting by 698 keeping you here.
Not you...
 605 But them!
 603 Ha... ha... 
 604 You...
... at my most 698 vulnerable 698 moment...
To think I was 698 worried you 698 wouldn't fit 698 in out there...
 605 Eheheheh!!! 698 You really are 698 no different than 698 them!

* Really now.
 604 * ...
* Hey 611 , do not go down 698   here.
* I have something 698   to show you 698   upstairs.

* Ahead of us lies the 698   end of the RUINS.
* A one-way exit to the 698   rest of the underground.
* I am going to destroy 698   it.
* No one will ever 698   be able to leave 698   again.
* Now be a good child 698   and go upstairs.
* Do not worry about 698   me.
* Someone has to take 698   care of these flowers.
* Don't worry about 698   me.
* Someone has to take 698   care of these flowers.
* Frisk 611 , please leave 698   me alone.
 603 * I can't come back 611 . 698 * I just can't 611 , OK?
 607 * I don't want to break 698   their hearts all over 698   again.
* It's better if they 698   never see me.
 607 * ... why are you still 698   here?
* Are you trying to keep 698   me company?
 600 * Frisk...
* ...
 607 * Hey.
 600 * Let me ask you a 698   question.
* Frisk.. 611 . 698 * Why did you come 698   here?
* Everyone knows the 698   legend 611 , right...?
* "Travellers who climb 698   Mt. Ebott are said 698   to disappear."
 607 * ...
* Frisk.
* 600  Why would you ever 698   climb a mountain 698   like that?
 607 * Was it foolishness?
 600 * Was it fate?
 601 * Or was it.. 611 . 698 * Because you...?
 607 * Well.
 600 * Only you know the 698   answer 611 , don't you...?
 602 * I know why  620  698   climbed the mountain.
 607 * It wasn't for a 698   very happy reason.
 602 * Frisk 611 . 698 * I'll be honest with 698   you.
 607 *  620  hated humanity.
 602 * Why they did 611 , they 698   never talked about 698   it.
 601 * But they felt very 698   strongly about 698   that.
 602 * Frisk.. 611 . 698 * You really ARE different 698   from  620 .
 600 * In fact 611 , though you 698   have similar 611 , uh 611 , 698   fashion choices...
* I don't know why I 698   ever acted like you 698   were the same person.
 607 * Maybe.. 611 . 698 * The truth is...
 601 *  620  wasn't really 698   the greatest person.
 607 * While 611 , Frisk...
 600 * You're the type of 698   friend I wish I 698   always had.
 607 * So maybe I was kind 698   of projecting a 698   little bit.
 600 * Let's be honest 611 . 698 * I did some weird 698   stuff as a flower.
 602 * There's one last 698   thing I feel like 698   I should tell you.
* Frisk 611 , when  620  698   and I combined our 698   SOULs together...
* The control over our 698   body was actually split 698   between us.
* They were the one 698   that picked up their 698   own empty body.
* And then 611 , when we 698   got to the village...
 602 * They were the one 698   that wanted to...
 601 * ... to use our full 698   power.
 602 * I was the one that 698   resisted.
 607 * And then 611 , because of 698   me 611 , we...
 601 * Well 611 , that's why I 698   ended up a flower.
 602 * Frisk...
* This whole time 611 , I've 698   blamed myself for 698   that decision.
* That's why I adopted 698   that horrible view 698   of the world.
* "Kill or be killed."
 607 * But now.. 611 . 698 * After meeting you...
 600 * Frisk 611 , I don't regret 698   that decision anymore.
 604 * I did the right 698   thing.
* If I killed those 698   humans...
* We would have had to 698   wage war against all 698   of humanity.
 600 * And in the end 611 , 698   everyone went free 611 , 698   right?
 607 * I still feel kind 698   of sad knowing how 698   long it took...
 600 * ... so maybe it 698   wasn't a perfect 698   decision.
* But you can't regret 698   hard choices your 698   whole life 611 , right?
 607 * Well 611 , not that I 698   have much of a life 698   left.
 600 * But that's besides 698   the point.
* Frisk 611 , thank you 698   for listening to me.
* You should really go 698   be with your friends 698   now 611 , OK?
* Oh 611 , and 611 , please...
 607 * In the future 611 , if you 698   uh 611 , see me...
* Don't think of it as 698   me 611 , OK?
 600 * I just want you to 698   remember me like this.
 600 * Someone that was your 698   friend for a little 698   while.
 602 * Oh 611 , and Frisk...
 600 * Be careful in the 698   outside world 611 , OK?
* Despite what everyone 698   thinks 611 , it's not as 698   nice as it is here.
 607 * There are a lot of 698   Floweys out there.
 602 * And not everything can 698   be resolved by just 698   being nice.
 600 * Frisk...
* Don't kill 611 , and 698   don't be killed 611 , 698   alright?
* That's the best you 698   can strive for.
* Well 611 , see you.
 607 * Frisk...
 606 * Don't you have 698   anything better to 698   do?

* Thaaaaat's politics!

* Awful teens tormented 698   a local monster by decorating 698   its tree-like horns.

* Hmm 611 ? 698 * Adjusting the presents is 698   my responsibility.
* Nah 611 , to be honest 611 , I 698   just keep looking to see 698   if I've gotten one...
* It'll be nice to show humans 698   our presents-under-the-tree 698   tradition.
* They'll probably be weirded 698   out by it.
* You know what's cute?
* Those two married dogs 698   always put presents under 698   the tree for each other.

* That's strange 611 . 698 * There was a present here 698   for Papyrus...
* Now it's gone 611 . 698 * Did someone steal it?
* That lady over there...
* Something about her disturbs 698   me.
* I think I've figured it out 611 . 698 * ... no 611 , nevermind.
* That lady over there's 698   been going for a walk 698   for a while now.
* ... but she hasn't moved 698   an inch from where she's 698   standing.
* W-well 611 , I haven't either 611 , 698   but I don't want her to 698   notice me over here...
* Uhhh...
* Is anyone else weirded out 698   by those giant shambling 698   amalgamates 611 , or...?

* It's just a very slow one.

* But I definitely want to see 698   some city slickers slip onto 698   their butts!
* Yeah 611 , bring 'em on!
* What will happen to 698   Grillby's if everyone 698   moves in...?
* We're gonna have to have 698   chairs to the ceiling.
* Hey 611 ! People won't have to 698   move in from the city 698   anymore!
* Seems like we won't have 698   to lose our local culture.
* ... except we're all moving 698   out of here 611 , huh.
* Oh well 611 . Guess it can't be 698   all punk-peaches and punk- 698   cream.

* Hiya 611 ! 698 * You look like you 698   had a great sleep.
* Which is incredible 611 , because 698   you were only up there for 698   about two minutes...
* Here's your money back 611 . 698 * You can pay me if you're 698   going to stay overnight.
* Feel free to come back 698   if you get tired.
* Yo 611 ! 698 * You're a kid too 611 , right?
* I can tell 'cause you're 698   wearing a striped shirt.
* I wonder if that weird skeleton 698   is an adult or a kid.
* Yo.. 611 . 698 * There you are!
* I've been kinda worried 698   about you since you 698   ran away.
* ... but now I'm just kinda 698   mad 611 , ha ha.
* If Undyne hadn't saved me 611 , 698   that woulda been bad...
* ...
* Yo.. 611 . 698 * Uh...
* Don't talk to me.
* ...
* Yo!! 611 ! 698 * What's up!?
* I've been kinda 611 , doing 698   some thinking...
* Maybe Undyne... 698 * Isn't actually as cool as 698   we thought.
* She's just kinda.. 611 . mean.
* But YO!! 611 ! 698 * I just found out about 698   someone WAYYY cooler!!!
* Nyeh heh heh!!!
* Nyeh heh heh 611 , dude.
* Yo 611 , everyone ran away and 698   hid somewhere.
* Man 611 , adults can be so 698   dumb sometimes 611 , haha...
* Don't they know we've 698   got Undyne to protect us!?
* Yo 611 ! 698 * Are you sneaking out to 698   see her 611 , too?
* Awesome.. 611 . 698 * She's the coolest 611 , right!?
* I wanna be just like her 698   when I grow up...
* Hey 611 , don't tell my parents 698   I'm here 611 . 698 * Ha ha.
* OK 611 , I'm ready when you 698   are.
* Yo 611 ! 698 * Where were you going...?
* My parents didn't tell you 698   to come here 611 , did they?
* You know where you're 698   going 611 , right...?
* I was just gonna follow 698   you.. 611 . 698 * Ha ha.
* Yo 611 , this ledge is way 698   too steep...
* Hmmm....
* Yo 611 , you aren't going to 698   be able to climb with 698   an umbrella.
* We all know the underground 698   has problems 611 , but we 698   smile anyway.
* Why?
* We can't do anything 611 , so 698   why be morose about it?
* Smile smile.
* Maybe I'll try frowning 698   for once.
* ... no 611 . 698 * I just can't do it.
* Oh 611 ? 698 * We're free?
* Finally.. 611 . 698 * I'll be able to stop 698   smiling.
* Just now 611 , I felt my smile 698   falter for a moment.
* What's wrong?
* Ah 611 , to be young again 611 . 698 * The world sure felt boundless.
* You like to wander 611 . 698 * You must be young.
* Seems like this is the 698   beginning of a brand-new 611 , 698   boundless world...
* Wah-ha 611 ! 698 * This adventurous spirit 611 ! 698 * I'm like a kid again!
* And my children are like.. 611 . 698 * Double-children.
* I've sent the kids inside.
* It feels unsafe here today.
* You aren't gonna make me 698   be the human again 611 , are you?
* Can we PLEASE play something 698   else...?
* Hmmm.. 611 . 698 * When humans play Monsters 698   and Humans...
* Do they just call it 698   Humans and Humans?
* Let's play Monsters and Humans!
* Let's continue to play 698   Monsters and Humans!
* Now we can play Monsters 698   and Humans with REAL humans!
* Everyone is always laughing 698   and cracking jokes 611 , trying 698   to forget our modern crises...
* Dreariness 611 . 698 * Crowding 611 . 698 * Lack of sunlight.
* I would join them 611 , but I'm 698   just not very funny.
* At least I'm not making puns.
* Wait 611 ! 698 * I've got a joke!
* Knock knock!
* ... Uh 611 . 698 * That's all I've thought of.
* Looks like I don't have 698   to worry about cracking 698   jokes anymore.
* ...
* I was going to say a joke 698   here 611 , but I really don't 698   have one.
* It just feels like.. 611 . 698 * Like everything is getting 698   worse and worse.
* I "put out a line" for some 698   girls today.
* Someone told me that there 698   are plenty of fish in the 698   sea...
* Well 611 , I'm taking that 698   seriously.
* I'm literally going to make 698   out with a fish.
* I guess I could ask out Undyne 611 . 698 * But I think she likes someone 698   already.
* Did I catch anyone yet 611 ? 698 * I can't bear to look...
* Sans is the most regular 698   regular of all.
* He hasn't been showing up 698   as much recently though.
* Where the heck is Sans?
* He told me he had some 698   bait I could use.
* Though it was probably 698   some kind of prank.
* But I wanted to know what 698   the prank was!
* In the end 611 , I never caught 698   any girls on my fishing 698   line.
* So kid 611 , take it from me...
* Don't try to catch hot 698   people with a fishing rod.
* (Somewhere 611 , you hear a whinny 698   of dismay.)
HEY 611 , SANS 611 , HAVE 698 YOU SEEN MY...
 600 OH, HELLO 611 . 698 YOU AREN'T SANS.
 603 WAIT A SECOND.
 600 WHY WERE YOU USING 698 A TREADMILL IN 698 THE DARK?
 603 IS SANS PRANKING 698 YOU ACROSS TIME 698 AND SPACE?
 601 I HATE IT WHEN 698 HE DOES THAT!
 601 HOW IMMATURE CAN 698 YOU GET?
 603 ALSO 611 , HAVE YOU 698 SEEN MY ACTION 698 FIGURES?
 600 WAIT 611 ! 698 I KNOW WHERE TO 698 LOOK!!!
IN MY COLLECTION 611 ! 698 NYEH HEH HEH!!!
SOMETIMES 611 , I'M A 698 GENIUS 611 . 698 ALL THE TIME.

Greetings.
I 612  am  620 .
Thank you.
Your power awakened 698 me from death.
My "human soul."
My "determination."
They were not mine 611 , 698 but YOURS.
At first 611 , I 698 was so confused.
Our plan had failed 611 , 698 hadn't it?
Why was I brought 698 back to life?
...
You.
With your guidance.
I realized the purpose 698 of my reincarnation.
Power.
Together 611 , we eradicated 698 the enemy and became 698 strong.
HP. ATK. DEF. 698 GOLD. EXP. LV.
Every time a number 698 increases 611 , that 698 feeling...
That's me.
" 620 ."
Now.
Now, we have reached 698 the absolute.
There is nothing 698 left for us here.
Let us erase this 698 pointless world 611 , and 698 move on to the next.
" 620 ."
The demon that comes 698 when people call 698 its name.
It doesn't matter when.
It doesn't matter where.
Time after time, 698 I will appear.
And, with your help.
We will eradicate the 698 enemy and become 698 strong.
HP. ATK. DEF. 698 GOLD. EXP. LV.
Every time a number 698 increases 611 , that 698 feeling...
That's me.
" 620 ."
...
But.
You and I are not 698 the same 611 , are we?
This SOUL resonates 698 with a strange 698 feeling.
There is a reason 698 you continue to 698 recreate this world.
There is a reason 698 you continue to 698 destroy it.
You.
You are wracked with 698 a perverted 698 sentimentality.
Hmm.
I cannot understand 698 these feelings 698 any more.
Despite this.
I feel obligated to 698 suggest.
Should you choose to 698 create this world 698 once more.
Another path would 698 be better suited.
Now, partner.
Let us send this 698 world back into the 698 abyss.
Right 611 . You are a 698 great partner.
We'll be together 698 forever 611 , won't we?
No...?
Hmm...
How curious.
You must have 698 misunderstood.
SINCE WHEN WERE YOU 698 THE ONE IN CONTROL?
No...?
Hmm... 698 This feeling you have.
This is what I 698 spoke of.
Unfortunately, 698 regarding this...
YOU MADE YOUR CHOICE 698 LONG AGO.
It's not 698 like I 698 LIKE 698 you.
Id... 698 Idiot!
Hmph! 698 Don't 698 get in 698 my way.
>_<... 698 Human 698 ...
... 698 H-human 698 ... 698 ...?
Id... 698 Idiot!
Eeeeh? 698 H-human 698 ...?
Human, 698 I...
Huh!? 698 Y-you 698 sicko!
Ah... 698 Is that 698 true...?
No way! 698 Why 698 would I 698 like YOU
Human, 698 I...

* You tell Tsunderplane it has 698   an impressive wingspan.
* You tell Tsunderplane it has 698   an impressive wingspan.

* Th-though 611 , I guess if 698   there's nowhere else 611 , you 698   can stand closer...

* A-ah.. 611 . H-human.. 611 . 698 * You're leaving?
* I have.. 611 . 698 * Something to say to you.
* Admittedly 611 , I may have had 698   limerent feelings for you 698   before.
* However 611 , upon examining my 698   own actions 611 , I now 698   realize...
* I did not love YOU.
* I was merely infatuated 698   with the CONCEPT of love.
* The idea of romance 611 , the 698   concept of sharing affection 698   with another...
* Through these desires 611 , I 698   built a false concept of 698   you in my head.
* Such a relationship would 698   not have ended well.
* In closing 611 , I believe it 698   is better that I chose to 698   say nothing.

 603 Alphys told me that 698 she would watch me 698 fight you...
 604 And if anything went 698 wrong 611 , she would.. 611 . 698 evacuate everyone.
 605 By now she's called 698 ASGORE and told him 698 to absorb the 6 698 human SOULs.
And with that 698 power...
This world will 698 live on...!
* Hey 611 , punk 611 ! 698 * What's up!?

BECAUSE I HATE 698 GREASE.

NO 611 , BUT I HAVE 698 STANDARDS!!!
* Papyrus...
 601 * Why do you live 698   in an icy wasteland?
THE RENT'S CHEAP.
* Really 611 ? 698 * Don't you live in 698   a huge house?

Show me what 698 you've got!
Do your worst!
What's the 698 matter, scared?
 606 What the hell 698 is the holdup?
COME ON ALREADY!
IT'S GETTING 698 HOT IN HERE!

* Undyne is letting you make 698   the first attack.
* UNDYNE - ATK 41 DEF 21 698 * This time 611 , don't hold 698   anything back!
* You pretend to swing at 698   UNDYNE with all your might.
I've been 698 defeated.. 611 . 698 My house is in 698 shambles...
I even failed to 698 befriend you.
That's it.
 608 I don't care if 698 you're my guest 698 anymore.
 606 One final rematch 611 ! 698 All out on both 698 sides!!!
IT'S THE ONLY WAY 698 I CAN REGAIN MY 698 LOST PRIDE!!!
NOW COME ON 611 ! 698 HIT ME WITH 698 ALL YOU'VE GOT! 698 NGAHHHH!!!
* Undyne is letting you make 698   the first attack.
What.
 602 That's the best 698 you can manage?
 603 Even attacking at 698 full force...
You just can't 698 muster any intent 698 to hurt me 611 , 698 huh?
 604 ...
 607 Heh 611 , you know 698 what?
I don't actually 698 want to hurt you 698 either.
At first 611 , I hated 698 your stupid 698 saccharine 698 schtick 611 , but...
 603 The way you hit 698 me right now 611 , 698 it...
 604 Reminded me of 698 someone I used 698 to train with.
 607 Now I know you 698 aren't just some 698 wimpy loser.
 609 You're a wimpy 698 loser with a 698 big heart!
 604 Just like him...
 607 ...
 603 Listen 611 , human.
 602 It seems that you 698 and ASGORE are 698 fated to fight.
 603 But knowing him...
 604 He probably 698 doesn't want to.
 602 Talk to him.
 601 I'm sure you can 698 persuade him to 698 let you go home.
 603 Eventually 611 , some 698 mean human will 698 fall down here...
 603 And I'll take 698 THEIR soul instead.
 601 That makes sense 611 , 698 right 611 ? 698 Fuhuhu.
 602 Oh 611 , and if you 698 DO hurt ASGORE...
 607 I'll take the 698 human souls.. 611 . 698 Cross the barrier...
 606 And beat the 698 hell out of you!
 609 That's what friends 698 are for 611 , right?
 609 Fuhuhu!
 609 Now let's get the 698 hell out of this 698 flaming house!
Ngahhh!
Bring 698 it on!
C'mon!
Fuhuhu!
Ngahh!!
Urahhh!!
 601   You're strong... 698   But not strong 698   enough!
 604   You're a pain in 698   the neck, huh?
 605   DIE ALREADY, YOU 698   LITTLE BRAT!

   662 As long as you're 698    665 GREEN 662  you  661 CAN'T 698   ESCAPE 662 !
   662 Unless you learn 698   to  661 face danger 698   head-on 662 ...
  You won't last 698   a SECOND against 698   ME!
  You 611 ? 698   Sparing ME 611 ? 698   Fuhuhuhu!
  How insulting 611 ! 698   I'd NEVER 698   surrender to the 698   likes of you!
  Not bad 611 ! 698   Then how about 698   THIS!?
 600   I wanted this to 698   be a fair fight.
 601   I thought if I 698   beat you like 698   this...
  It'd truly show 698   how strong 698   monsters can be.
 604   BUT NOW???
 605   I DON'T CARE!
  I'M NOT YOUR 698   FREAKING 698   KINDERGARTEN 698   TEACHER!
 601   Unless your 698   kindergarten 698   teacher...
 605   DOES THIS!
 605   WHAT ARE YOU 698   DOING?
  JUST FACE 698   UPWARDS!!!
  IT'S NOT HARD!
 600  
 604   Look.
 604   I gave you a 698   spear to block 698   the bullets with.
 604   Do I have to 698   explain this 698   any more 698   clearly?
 600  
 601    662 When I said 698    661 face towards 698   danger 662 ...
 604   I meant face 698   towards the 698   bullets!
 600  
  For years, 698   we've dreamed 698   of a happy 698   ending...
  And now, 698   sunlight is 698   just within 698   our reach!
  I won't let 698   you snatch it 698   away from 698   us!
 601   NGAHHH! 698   Enough warming 698   up!
  Heh... 698   You're tough!
  Mercy 611 ! 698   Ha!
  I still can't 698   believe YOU 698   want to spare 698   ME!
  But even if 698   you could 698   beat me...
  But even if 698   I spared 698   YOU...
 662   No human has 698   EVER made it 698   past 698    661 ASGORE 662 !
  Honestly 611 , 698   killing you 698   now is an act 698   of mercy...!
  ...
  Honestly, I'm 698   doing you 698   a favor...
 662   No human has 698   EVER made it 698   past 698    661 ASGORE 662 !
 601   Killing you 698   now is an act 698   of mercy!
 604   So STOP being 698   so damn 698   resilient!
  What the 698   hell are 698   humans made 698   out of!?
  Anyone else 698   would be DEAD 698   by now!
  Alphys told me 698   humans were 698   determined...
  I see now what 698   she meant by 698   that!
  But I'm 698   determined, 698   too!
  Determined to 698   end this 698   RIGHT NOW!
  ... RIGHT NOW!
  ... RIGHT... 698   ... 698   ... NOW!!
  Ha... 698   Ha...
 605   NGAHHH!!! 698   DIE ALREADY, YOU 698   LITTLE BRAT!
  YOU'RE GETTING 698   IN MY WAY!
  I WILL NEVER 698   TAKE MERCY FROM 698   THE LIKES OF YOU!
  I WILL NOT 698   BE DEFEATED!
  YOU! WILL! 698   NEVER! SPARE! ME!
 662   YOU'LL NEVER  661 ESCAPE 662  698   FROM ME!!!
  Come on 611 , is that 698   all you've got!?
  ... pathetic.
  You're going to 698   have to try 698   harder than that!
  S-see how strong 698   we are when we 698   believe in 698   ourselves?
  H... heh...
  Had enough yet?
 607   ...
  ... I won't.. 611 . 698   ... give up...

 606 * Fuhuhu 611 ! 698 * What a joke!
* I could make friends 698   with a wimpy loser 698   like you any day!
 602 * I'll show him!
 603 * Listen up 611 , human.
 602 * We're not just 698   going to be 698   friends.
 603 * We're going to 698   be...
 651 * BESTIES.
* I'll make you 698   like me so much...
 601 * You won't be able 698   to think of anyone 698   else!!!
 603 * Fuhuhuhu 611 ! 698 * It's the PERFECT 698   REVENGE!!
* ...
 609 * Why don't you 698   have a seat?
* Oh 611 , leaving so soon?
 603 * No 611 . 698 * No you're not.
* Comfortable?
* I'll get you 698   something to drink.
* All set 611 ! 698 * What would you like?
* HEY!! 611 ! 698 * DON'T GET UP!!!
* YOU'RE THE GUEST! 611 ! 698 * SIT DOWN AND ENJOY 698   YOURSELF!!!
* ...
 609 * Um 611 , why not just 698   point to what you 698   want?
* You can use the 698   spear!
 604 * Y'know 611 , I was a 698   pretty hotheaded 698   kid.
* Once 611 , to prove I was 698   the strongest 611 , I tried 698   to fight ASGORE.
 601 * Emphasis on TRIED.
 600 * I couldn't land 698   a single blow 698   on him!
 604 * And worse 611 , the whole 698   time 611 , he refused 698   to fight back!
 607 * I was so 698   humiliated...
 600 * Afterwards 611 , he 698   apologized and said 698   something goofy...
* "Excuse me 611 , do you 698   want to know how 698   to beat me?"
 600 * I said yes 611 , and 698   from then on 611 , he 698   trained me.
 604 * One day 611 , during 698   practice 611 , I finally 698   knocked him down.
 607 * I felt.. 611 . bad.
 609 * But he was 698   beaming...
 606 * I had never seen 698   someone more proud to 698   get their butt kicked.
 601 * ... oh!
 609 * I almost forgot 698   about your tea!
* Just a moment!
* Wait a second.
* Papyrus.. 611 . 698 * His cooking lesson...
 652 * HE WAS SUPPOSED 698   TO HAVE THAT RIGHT 698   NOW!!!
 603 * And if HE's not 698   here to have it...
 602 * YOU'LL HAVE TO 698   HAVE IT FOR HIM!!!
* That's right!!!
 601 * NOTHING has brought 698   Papyrus and I 698   closer than cooking!
 603 * Which means that if 698   I give you his 698   lesson...
 602 * WE'LL BECOME CLOSER 698   THAN YOU CAN 698   EVER IMAGINE!!!
 606 * Fuhuhu!! 611 ! Afraid! 611 ? 698 * We're gonna be best 698   friends!!!
* Ready! 611 ? 698 * It's spaghetti time!
* Let's start with the 698   sauce!!
* Uhh 611 , we'll just scrape 698   this into a bowl 698   later.
 601 * But for NOW!
* Alright 611 ! 698 * Now it's time 698   to stir the pasta!
* As a general rule 698   of thumb 611 , the more 698   you stir...
 601 * THE BETTER IT IS!
 600 * Ready 611 ? 698 * Let's do it!
 650 * Fuhuhuhu 611 ! 698 * That's the stuff!
 600 * Alright 611 , now for 698   the final step:
 601 * TURN UP THE HEAT!
 600 * Let the stovetop 698   symbolize your 698   passion!
 601 * Let your hopes and 698   dreams turn into 698   burning fire!
 602 * READY 611 ? 698 * Don't hold anything 698   back!!!
* Ah.
* Man 611 , no wonder 698   Papyrus sucks at 698   cooking.
* So what's next 611 ? 698 * Scrapbooking 611 ? 698 * Friendship bracelets?
* ...
* ... oh 611 , who am I 698   kidding.
* I really screwed this 698   up 611 , didn't I?
 604 * I can't force you to 698   like me 611 , human.
 604 * Some people just 698   don't get along 698   with each other.
 607 * I understand if 698   you feel that 698   way about me.
 604 * And if we can't 698   be friends...
 607 * That's okay.
 607 * Because.. 611 . 698 * If we're not 698   friends...
 602 * 652  IT MEANS I CAN 698   DESTROY YOU WITHOUT 698   REGRET!
* It'll take a moment 698   for the water to 698   boil.
* Okay 611 , it's all 698   done!
* Here we are.
* Careful 611 , it's hot.
* It's not THAT hot! 611 ! 698 * Just drink it already!
 628   640   630  
* (You take a sip of the 698   tea. 611 ) 698 * (It's burning...)
* (But other than that 611 , 698   it's pretty good.)
* It's pretty good 611 , 698   right?
 606 * Nothing but the best 698   for my ABSOLUTELY 698   PRECIOUS FRIEND!!
 609 * Hey...
 609 * You know... 698 * It's kind of strange 698   you chose THAT tea.
 604 * Golden flower tea...
 600 * That's ASGORE's 698   favorite kind.
 604 * Actually 611 , now that 698   I think about it...
 609 * You kind of remind 698   me of him.
 606 * You're both TOTAL 698   weenies!!!
 607 * ... sort of.
 604 * Y'know 611 , I was a 698   pretty hotheaded 698   kid.
* Once 611 , to prove I was 698   the strongest 611 , I tried 698   to fight ASGORE.
 601 * Emphasis on TRIED.
 600 * I couldn't land 698   a single blow 698   on him!
 604 * And worse 611 , the whole 698   time 611 , he refused 698   to fight back!
 607 * I was so 698   humiliated...
 600 * Afterwards 611 , he 698   apologized and said 698   something goofy...
* "Excuse me 611 , do you 698   want to know how 698   to beat me?"
 600 * I said yes 611 , and 698   from then on 611 , he 698   trained me.
 604 * One day 611 , during 698   practice 611 , I finally 698   knocked him down.
 607 * I felt.. 611 . bad.
 609 * But he was 698   beaming...
 606 * I had never seen 698   someone more proud to 698   get their butt kicked.
 604 * Anyway 611 , long story 698   short 611 , he kept training 698   me...
 600 * And now I'm the 698   head of the Royal 698   Guard!
 606 * So I'm the one 698   who gets to train 698   dorks to fight!
 609 * ... like 611 , uh 611 , Papyrus.
 604 * But 611 , um 611 , to be 698   honest...
 609 *... I don't know if...
 607 * I can ever let 698   Papyrus into the 698   Royal Guard.
 601 * Don't tell him I 698   said that!
 604 * He's just.. 611 . 698 * Well...
 609 * I mean 611 , it's not 698   that he's weak.
 601 * He's actually 698   pretty freaking 698   tough!
 607 * It's just that.. 611 . 698 * He's...
 601 * He's too innocent 698   and nice!!!
 607 * I mean 611 , look 611 , he 698   was SUPPOSED to 698   capture you...
 605 * And he ended up 698   being FRIENDS with 698   you instead!
 601 * I could NEVER send 698   him into battle!
 607 * He'd get ripped 698   into little smiling 698   shreds.
 607 * That's part of why...
 609 * I started teaching 698   him how to cook 611 , 698   you know?
 607 * So 611 , um 611 , maybe he 698   can do something 698   else with his life.
 601 * Oh 611 , sorry 611 , I was 698   talking for so 698   long...
 609 * You're out of tea 611 , 698   aren't you?
 600 * I'll get you some 698   more.
PSST.
 600 MAKE SURE TO 698 GIVE HER THIS!
SHE LOVES THESE!
* Hi 611 , Papyrus!
* Ready for your extra- 698   private 611 , one-on-one 698   training?
YOU BET I AM!
AND I BROUGHT 698 A FRIEND!
* Hi 611 , I don't think 698   we've...
 602 * ...
 659 * ...
 650 ...
 601 * Why don't 611 . 698 * You two 611 . 698 * Come in?
* (You hear someone shouting 698   a whisper at you from 698   inside the house.)
NO 611 ! 698 YOU CAN'T ESCAPE 698 FRIENDSHIP!!
* Yo.. 611 . did you see that!?
* Undyne just...
* ... TOUCHED ME!
* I'm never washing my face 698   ever again...!
* Man 611 , are you unlucky.
* If you were standing just 698   a LITTLE bit to the left...!
* Yo 611 , don't worry 611 ! 698 * I'm sure we'll see her 698   again!
* ... yo 611 , did you notice 611 ? 698 * She seemed really mad 698   about something!
* She looked liked she was 698   gonna blast me to pieces!
* But.. 611 . sigh.. 611 . 698 * Then she decided to put 698   me down...
* Yo 611 ! 698 * There's always next time 611 , 698   right 611 ? Let's go!
It sounds like it 698 came from over 698 here...
Oh 611 ! You've fallen 698 down 611 , haven't you...
Are you okay?
Here 611 , get up...
...

* (There's a message crumpled 698   up in the trash can.)
* (It's in a strange kind 698   of handwriting.)
* (It says...)
* (I KNOW WHAT YOU DID.)
* Seven.
 660 * Seven human souls 611 , and 698    661 King ASGORE 660  will become 698   a god.
* Six.
* That's how many we have 698   collected thus far.
* Understand?
* Through your seventh and 698   final soul 611 , this world will 698   be transformed.
* First 611 , however 611 , as is customary 698   for those who make it this 698   far...
* I shall tell you the tragic 698   tale of our people.
* It all started 611 , long ago...
* ...
* No 611 , you know what?
* SCREW IT 613 ! 
* WHY SHOULD I TELL THAT STORY 611   
* WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO DIE!? 611 !   
* NGAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 611 ! 
* YOU!
* You're standing in 698   the way of everybody's 698   hopes and dreams!
 604 * Alphys's history books 698   made me think 698   humans were cool...
 600 * ... with their giant 698   robots and flowery 698   swordswomen.
 601 * BUT YOU?
 602 * You're just a coward!
 603 * Hiding behind that kid 698   so you could run away 698   from me again!
* You abandoned your 698   friend just so you 698   could run away!
 602 * And let's not forget 698   your wimpy goody-two- 698   shoes-schtick!
 606 * Oooh 611 ! I'm making such a 698   difference by hugging 698   random strangers!
* 603  You know what would 698   be more valuable 698   to everyone?
* 601  IF YOU WERE DEAD!!!
 600 * That's right 611 , human 611 ! 698 * Your continued 698   existence is a crime!
* Your life is all 698   that stands between 698   us and our freedom!
* Right now 611 , I can 698   feel everyone's hearts 698   pounding together!
 600 * Everyone's been 698   waiting their whole 698   lives for this moment!
 600 * But we're not 698   nervous at all.
 601 * When everyone puts 698   their hearts together 611 , 698   they can't lose!
 605 * Now 611 , human 611 ! 698 * Let's end this 611 , 698   right here 611 , right now.

 607 *... and something's 698   been bothering me 611 , 698   too.
 604 * The whole time I was 698   chasing after you...
 607 * I felt something.. 611 . 698 * Strange.
* The echoes of something 698   warm 611 , something...
 609 * Something like "I miss 698   being friends with you."
 602 * BUT THAT'S RIDICULOUS!
 606 I WOULD NEVER GET 698   CHUMMY WITH A COWARD 698   LIKE YOU!
 601 * You 611 ! 698 * You must have been 698   mind-controlling me!
 606 * Manipulating people to 698   make them like you.. 611 . 698 * What a Grade-A FREAK!
 601 * Now enough 611 ! 698 * For everyone's hopes 611 ! 698 * For everyone's dreams!
 602 * And for my own 698   freaking dignity!
 603 * I 611 , UNDYNE 611 , will 698   knock you down!
* YOU!
* You're standing in 698   the way of everybody's 698   hopes and dreams!
 604 * Alphys's history books 698   made me think humans 698   were compassionate...
 601 * BUT YOU?
 605 * You're just a 698   remorseless criminal!
* You wander through the 698   caverns 611 , attacking 698   anyone in your path.
 604 * Self-defense 611 ? 698 * Please.
* You didn't kill them 698   because you had to.
 605 * You killed them 698   because it was 698   easy for you.
* Because it was fun 698   for you.
 604 * Do you think it 698   was fun when I 698   found out...?
* Do you think it's 698   fun when people's 698   family members...
* ... never come home 611 ? 698 * Is that fun?

* ...
* Forget it.
* Look.

 605 * But Papyrus has 698   NEVER missed a 698   meeting.
 604 * And no matter what 698   time you call him 698   on the phone...
* Night 611 , day 611 , afternoon 611 , 698   morning...
 605 * He ALWAYS answers 698   within the first 698   two rings.
 604 * ...
* But now he's gone.
* And his brother 698   isn't around 611 , 698   either.
 605 * ...

 604 * Papyrus 611 , who I have 698   trained every day...
* Even though I KNOW 698   he's too goofy to 698   ever hurt anyone...
 605 * ...

DOGGO'S NOT HOME.
CAREFUL! 611 ! 698 THE ICE IS 698 SLPPERY.
 600 BUT IF YOU SLIDE 698 ON THE ICE 611 , NO ONE 698 WILL ATTACK YOU.
 603 NO ONE WANTS TO 698 PRATFALL DURING A 698 COOL TECHNIQUE.
I'M COLD OUT OF 698 THINGS TO SAY.
IT MUST BE TOUGH 698 BEING A SNOWMAN.
 602 TRY TO BE NICE 698 TO PEOPLE MADE OF 698 STRANGE MATERIALS.

NOTHING LIKE A 698 HOT BUCKET OF 698 SPAGH...
THIS ROOM IS 698 NORMALLY BLOCKED 698 BY THOSE SPIKES.
 603 BUT WE'RE THINKING 698 OF GETTING RID 698 OF THEM...
 600 THE KING RELEASED 698 A MANDATE ON 698 PUZZLES RECENTLY.
 603 HE THINKS SPIKES 698 ARE INEFFECTIVE AND 698 HAZARDOUS TO KIDS.
 604 BUT I THINK HE'S 698 WRONG!!!
 600 KIDS LOVE DEADLY 698 SPIKES!!!
IF YOU KNOW ANY 698 KIDS 611 , YOU SHOULD 698 ASK THEM!!!
HMMM.. 611 . 698 THE SOLUTION TO 698 THIS ONE...?
 605 I ACTUALLY JUST 698 STEPPED OVER THE 698 SPIKES.
 600 SO THE SOLUTION 698 IS TO BE VERY 698 TALL AND HANDSOME.
I'M SOLVING IT 698 AS WE SPEAK...
OH-HO!! 611 !  698 THIS PUZZLE 611 !
YOU FIGURED IT OUT 698 SO EASILY!!
 602 THAT WAS VERY 698 PAPYRUS OF YOU.

ACTUALLY 611 , IT'S ONE 698 OF HIS BETTER 698 LUMPS.
I ALWAYS JUMP OVER 698 THE GAP INSTEAD OF 698 SOLVING THE PUZZLE.
SANS NEVER SOLVES 698 IT EITHER.
 603 HE ALWAYS JUST.. 611 . 698 UM...
GETS ACROSS.
I THINK HE HAS 698 A SHORTCUT OR 698 SOMETHING.
GYFTROT LIVES NEAR 698 THERE 611 . 698 THEY LIKE GIFTS.
 603 DON'T WORRY IF 698 YOU CAN'T AFFORD 698 SOMETHING NICE.
 600 IT'S THE THOUGHT 698 THAT COUNTS.
SO IMAGINE YOU 698 HAVE A LOT OF 698 MONEY...
DID YOU MEET 698 GYFTROT?
MY SIGNAL IS 698 GETTING WEAK.

HELLO.

 603 HE LOOKS A BIT 698 LIKE A CERTAIN DOG 698 I DON'T LIKE.

 602 HE'S ONLY A 698 KLEPTOMANIAC 698 FOR AFFECTION!
HE'S AMASSED A 698 LARGE COLLECTION 698 OF HUGS AND PETS.
THIS BRIDGE LOOKS 698 DANGEROUS 611 , BUT 698 IT'S VERY STABLE.
IN FACT 611 , IT'S JUST 698 A ROCK FORMATION 698 I PAINTED OVER.
I THINK IT LOOKS 698 MORE DRAMATIC 698 THAT WAY.

WHY ARE YOU 698 CALLING ME?
 600 ARE YOU TRYING 698 TO MAKE A 698 RESERVATION???
* Hey 611 , I always stay 698   there when I come 698   to Snowdin!
 604 * I used to stay 698   at Papyrus's 611 , but...
 601 * His couch is like 611 , 698   lumpy and jangly?

 603 THOUGH I GUESS 698 IT'S TECHNICALLY 698 SANS'S HOUSE TOO.
 601 BUT I PREFER NOT 698 TO DISCUSS HIS 698 PART OF IT.
 603 HIS ROOM IS.. 611 . 698 IT'S LIKE ANOTHER 698 WORLD!
 602 A WORLD WHERE 698 THEY DON'T KNOW 698 HOW TO VACUUM.
YOU'RE BEST 698 STAYING AWAY FROM 698 THAT STRANGE PLACE.

NORMAL FOLKS CAN 698 ONLY DREAM OF 698 SUCH SLOTH...
* This is Papyrus's 698   brother's station.
 604 * I'm always catching 698   him slacking off 611 , 698   or sleeping...
 602 * But his results are 698   JUST good enough 698   to not fire him.
 604 * Well 611 , except today.
 602 * He didn't tell me 698   ANYTHING about you.
 604 * JUST scraping by 698   the bare minimum 698   every time...
 609 * I guess it's kind 698   of impressive...?
ROCKS?
 600 IT MUST BE ONE 698 OF UNDYNE'S 698 INGENIOUS PUZZLES.
 600 YOU'D BETTER BE 698 CAREFUL!!!
BE WARY OF ROCKS.
* God 611 , I was supposed 698   to build a puzzle 698   for this room...
 602 * But I HATE puzzles.

ARE YOU IN THE 698 TOILET?
ALSO 611 , WHAT'S A 698 TOILET?

* It's nice to have 698   a rainy spot away 698   from civilization...
 607 * Though 611 , with the city 698   filling up 611 , who knows 698   how long that'll last.

 604 * She looked pretty.. 611 . 698 * Um.. 611 . 698 * ... contemplative.
 609 * So I asked her 698   where she thought 698   the abyss led to!
 602 * She looked up at 698   me 611 , shocked 611 , and went 698   red in the face.
 606 * But I'm scary 611 , 698   so I'm used to 698   that kinda stuff!
 601 * Then she kept 698   explaining all her 698   different theories.
 609 * She went on for 698   hours 611 ! 698 * I was so captivated!
 601 * After that 611 , I kept 698   running into her 698   here.

* The garbage dump! 611 ! 698 * So many great things 698   come from there!!
 600 * The only reason we 698   have modern 698   technology...
* Is 'cause of all the 698   human junk that flows 698   from the surface!
 609 * Plus 611 , it's a GREAT 698   place to meet 698   girls.
* Wait 611 ! 698 * Don't quote me on 698   that one!!!

 600 * Then they would 698   practice these 698   weird performances.
 604 * Where'd they go...?
* Don't feel like you 698   have to live up 698   to their cousin!
 606 * Just be your lovable 698   old garbage self!

 607 * They've all.. 611 . 698 * Passed on...
 609 * ... to different jobs 611 , 698   since there's not 698   much business here.
 600 * Them and their cousin 698   stayed behind to run 698   the family farm.
 604 * But no one's seen 698   their cousin for a 698   long time.

 609 * You don't even need 698   to light up the 698   mushrooms!
 600 * I mean 611 , the path 698   to Temmie Village is 698   never lit up here.
 606 * But why would you 698   wanna go there!?
* It's down south if 698   you want to avoid 698   it.
LANTERNS 611 ? 698 UM 611 , OKAY...

HMMM.. 611 . 698 A CORRIDOR FILLED 698 WITH WATER.
 600 THAT'S JUST A 698 GUESS.
I HAVE NOTHING 698 TO SAY.
* That's where I first 698   talked to you!
 603 * Weren't you SUPER 698   terrified?
 602 * I practice that 698   monologue ALL the 698   time in the mirror!
UNDYNE???
* I mean!! 611 ! 698 * Uh!! 611 ! 698 * No I don't!!!

ECHO FLOWERS...

 601 * NGAHHHH!! 611 ! 698 * IT FILLS ME WITH 698   POWER!!!
* NGAHHHH!!
EACH AREA HAS TO 698 HAVE A PRECARIOUS 698 BRIDGE.
IT'S MANDATED BY 698 THE GOVERNMENT.
OF COURSE 611 , KING 698 FLUFFYBOY WANTS TO 698 UNMANDATE IT SAFER.
 601 WHY!! 611 ? WON'T HE 698 THINK OF THE 698 CHILDREN!?
SPIKES 611 . DANGER 698 BRIDGES 611 . THE 698 PILLARS OF YOUTH.
* This room...!
* Error?
 607 * That sure was a 698   tense scenario.
 604 * I just wanted to 698   help that poor kid 611 , 698   but...
 601 * I thought if I tried 611 , 698   you'd attack me!
 609 * Thankfully 611 , you 698   ended up saving 698   them.
 607 * I'd actually.. 611 . 698 * Forgotten what had 698   happened here.
 604 * You just let that 698   poor kid drop to 698   the floor.
* Maybe you were just 698   afraid.
 607 * But if I hadn't 698   been around 611 , then...?
 602 * That's when you ran 698   away when your friend 698   asked for help!!!
 609 * Though 611 , who can blame 698   you for fleeing from 698   certain death...?
 606 * ME!!! 611 ! 698 * I'm still TOTALLY 698   disappointed!
 601 * That's the WIMPIEST 698   thing you've EVER 698   done!
* Apologize to your 698   poor friend 611 , OK 611 , 698   buster!?
* ...
THIS IS WHERE 698 ELDER PUZZLER 698 LIKES TO STAND.

* Yeah 611 , someone else 698   has to care so I 698   don't have to!
BUT UNDYNE 611 , DON'T 698 YOU LIKE TRADITION?
* I worked in an office 698   pushing blocks for 698   a month!
 609 * My respect for block 698   puzzles was depleted 698   by corporate life.
WHAT! 611 ? YOU THREW 698 AWAY MY DREAM 698 LIFE!!!
 602 THE LIFE OF A 698 SIMPLE SALARYMAN...
COMMUTING EVERY 698 DAY ON A TRAIN 698 FULL OF SPIKES...

UNDYNE 611 , DID YOU 698 REALLY HAVE AN 698 OFFICE JOB?
* Well 611 , it was more 698   of a 611 , uh 611 , community 698   service thing.
THAT'S UNDYNE! 611 ! 698 ALWAYS HELPING OUT 698 THE COMMUNITY!
* Uh 611 , yep 611 ! 698 * Totally of my own 698   volition there!
THAT'S UNDYNE'S 698 DRAMATIC CRAG.

* Oh my GOD!! 611 ! 698 * Wasn't this room 698   the BEST!?
 603 * Like when I decided 698   to NOT do that 698   BORING monologue...
 606 * And then went TOTALLY 698   off-the-cuff!?
 602 * Or when I almost 698   killed you with 698   spears???
 603 * Or when I almost 698   killed you with 698   MORE spears???
 609 * Aw man 611 . 698 * I should have taken 698   photos.

* Let's start a photo 698   company for boss 698   fights!
ONE WEEK LATER 611 , 698 SAMPLE GLOSSIES 698 IN THE MAIL.

 600 * Now I can take a 698   drink on the way 698   to her lab.
 601 * Though 611 , usually I'm 698   not wearing 100 698   pounds of armor...!
* Thanks for giving me 698   that water 611 , I guess.
A LAB?? 611 ? 698 MY BROTHER 698 WOULD LOVE THAT!
HE LOVES SCIENCE 698 FICTION!!

 603 WHICH 611 , SINCE I'M 698 ALWAYS WEARING 698 GLOVES...
 600 I DON'T KNOW 698 ANYTHING 698 ABOUT!!!
MY KNOWLEDGE 698 QUANTITY IS 698 STAGNANT.
NEITHER OF US 698 KNOW ANYTHING 698 ABOUT HOTLAND.
* So we'll just have 698   to COMBINE OUR 698   POWER!!!
ZERO PLUS ZERO 698 IS STILL ZERO.
* Yeah 611 , but it's a 698   BIG zero!!!

GLAD I DON'T 698 LIVE IN HOTLAND!!
* Steam vents 611 ? 698 * I think Alphys told 698   me about those.
* The CORE cools off 698   by releasing steam 698   through those...
 609 * And at the same 698   time 611 , it doubles 698   as transport!
 606 * Pretty cool 611 , if 698   you aren't wearing 698   a dress!
* Huh! 611 ? 698 * Did you put on 698   a dress?
ORANGE AND BLUE 698 LASERS 611 , HUH?

 600 BLUE MEANS 698 JUMP...

 600 THAT'S WHAT I 698 REMEMBER.
HAVE FUN!!
* What! 611 ? 698 * Why'd I call Alphys 698   about the weather?
 603 * Who CARES!?! 611 ? 698 * Isn't it natural 698   to love meteorology!?
ZOINKS!!!
 603 I THOUGHT THAT WAS 698 JUST AN EXCUSE 698 TO TALK TO HER.
I DIDN'T KNOW 698 THERE WAS WEATHER 698 DOWN HERE!!!
 601 * YEAH!?! 611 ! 698 * THERE IS?!!?!

IT'S OKAY 611 , I 698 FORGIVE YOU!
 603 (PSST 611 , WHEN WAS 698 SHE MAD AT ME?)
IT'S IMPORTANT TO 698 STAY IN SCHOOL.
 603 A REAL TEACHER...
 600 WOULD NEVER ACCEPT 698 DEADLY LASERS AS 698 AN EXCUSE!!
GLAD! 698 I DON'T 698 LIVE IN HOTLAND!!

 602 * Hey 611 , what if I 698   visited their 698   school!?
 606 * Then I could beat 698   up ALL the teachers!
* Okay 611 , maybe I 698   wouldn't beat up 698   a teacher...
OH NO 611 ! 698 THE PUZZLES 698 REACTIVATING...
 603 CAUSED THOSE 698 PEOPLE TO MISS 698 THEIR WORK!?

THE ELEVATOR 698 SAYS R2.
 603 BUT WHAT DOES THE 698 R STAND FOR 611 ? 698 RIGATONI?
 600 THE TUBE-SHAPED 698 PASTA.
IN A PINCH 611 , IT 698 CAN BE USED AS 698 A STRAW.

COVERS ITSELF 698 WITH A BLANKET 611 , 698 AND SLEEPS...
 602 * OK 611 , OK 611 . 698 * I've got it.

 600 REALLY!?
 603 I HATE LIMES.
 601 * What! 611 ? Limes rule! 611 ! 698 * I eat them whole 698   all the time!!
 603 WELL 611 , ONE TIME I 698 WAS GIVING MYSELF 698 THE SPA TREATMENT.
 600 I PUT THE LIME 698 SLICES IN MY 698 EYES 611 , LIKE ON TV.
 601 BUT IT STINGS! 611 ! 698 HOW DO THEY DO 698 IT!?
 606 * Oh my god 611 ! 698 * Those aren't LIMES 611 ! 698 * Those are CUCUMBERS!
 603 I THOUGHT IT WAS 698 SUPPOSED TO BE 698 REJUVENATING.
 601 BUT IT WASN'T 698 WORKING!
 605 SO I JUST STUCK 698 MORE LIMES INTO 698 MY EYES.
 601 * Gross! 611 ! 698 * Why did you even 698   do that!?
 602 I JUST WANT TO 698 HAVE HANDSOME 611 , 698 BISHONEN EYES.

AN APRON LYING 698 IN HOTLAND 611 ? 698 THAT MAKES SENSE.
 603 * Yeah 611 , cooking is 698   definitely fire- 698   elemental!

LIKE A KABOB BUT 698 WITH ONLY BONES.
 600 DO SPIDERS HAVE 698 WEBBED FEET?

I'VE HEARD THERE 698 ARE TWO GROUPS 698 OF SPIDERS.
ONE IN HOTLAND 611 , 698 AND ONE IN THE 698 RUINS.
 603 SINCE THE SPIDERS 698 CAN'T CROSS THE 698 COLD OF SNOWDIN.
THEY NEED SOME 698 KIND OF TRANSPORT.
 600 LIKE A TANDEM 698 MOTORCYCLE WITH 698 EIGHT WHEELS.
OR A UNICYCLE 698 WITH EIGHT 698 WHEELS!
I WONDER IF ANY 698 OF MY ONLINE 698 FANS ARE SPIDERS.
* Do spiders even 698   use the internet?

* Oh my GOD!!!
 606 * Anime isn't just for 698   kids 611 ! It's deep 611 ! 698 * It's EMOTIONAL!!!
IS (THE SOUND A 698 BABY MAKES) AN 698 EMOTION?
* YEah CAUSE It'S HoW 698   I'M FEElinG RIGHT 698   NOW!!!
WAIT...
 605 UNDYNE 611 , DO YOU 698 LIKE ANIME?
* ...

MAYBE I'M A BABY 698 WHO LOVES CARTOONS 698 FOR CHILDREN!
* YOU DON'T HAVE TO 698   SAY THAT 611 , PAPYRUS!!
* What! 611 ? 698 * Royal Guards are 698   blocking the way!?
 602 * Then I'll tell them 698   to...!
 604 * Well 611 , nothing 611 , I 698   guess.
 602 * I already told them 698   to seek out and 698   destroy you!
 601 * And I can't just 698   tell them I've 698   changed my mind.
 602 * You see 611 , Alphys 698   showed me these 698   animations about...
 601 * Uhhh 611 , humans? 698 * So I can learn 698   their weaknesses?
 602 * And one of them 698   is about this human 698   that 611 , uh...
 606 * Well 611 , suffice to say 611 , 698   they can control 698   people's minds!!!
 603 * Surprised 611 ? 698 * I know your kind's 698   hidden power!
 601 * Anyway 611 , I told my 698   crew that if I ever 698   defended a human...
 602 * I must be under 698   some kind of mind 698   control!
 606 * And to disregard 698   EVERYTHING that I 698   tell them!
 607 * So 611 , sorry.. 611 . 698 * But my hands are 698   tied.
 609 * By the way 611 , that 698   animation is 698   really good!
 606 * I'm not going to 698   tell them to let 698   you by!
* (No response.)

* Dear Frisk,

* Please look at this:
  ]: )
* Now turn your head to the 698   left.
* It is a picture of me 698   smiling at you 611 ! 698 * Can you see it?

* I did not mean to write 698   "sincerly." 698 * I meant to say "sincerely."
* It is difficult to use this 698   with large hands.
* Perhaps I should ask Sans 698   to transcribe for me.
* (TORIEL sent you a message. 611 ) 698 * Sans will be typing from 698   now on.

Live far apart    
Even if             
It breaks my heart  
They'll put you    
In the dungeon     
It'll suck         
And then you'll 699 die a lot  
Really sad         
You're gonna die     
Cry cry cry      
So sad it's 699 happening.       
Oh my love
Has fallen 699 down
Now in tears
We all will 699 drown
Colored 699 tiles
Make them 699 a fool

(Moving so far...)
(Who can blame you?)
(Hmmm, I'll have to get used 699 to it...)
(Even better than 699 I thought...)
(So that's what 699 it's like.)
(Dancing with... A human.)
(What a shame...)
