3332. ... and get rid of 698 this horrible prison.
3333. Then I would destroy 698 humanity ...

4554.  Didn't you know that 698 is nice ...
4555.  601 ... just makes you 698 hurt?
4556.  600 look up.
4557.  609 You have all 698 amazing friends ...
4558.  600 But now, 611, you probably 698 will never see them again.
4559.  609 not to mention how much they got back from you.
4560.  606 Hurts 611, right?
4561.  607 If you just went through 698 without bothering us around 698 about anyone ...
4562.  606 you wouldn't need 698 which is bad now.
4563.  600 so I don't get it.
4564.  607 If you were actually 698 okay 698 ...
4565.  why did things 698 end like this?
4566.  606 Why ...?
4567.  605 Is Life Really 698 So Unfair?
4568.  609 ...
4569.  600 sig.
4570.  609 What if I told you ...
4571.  600 I somehow knew that 698 had a better 698 ending?
4572.  609 You must upload your 698 SAVE file, and ...
4573.  609 You must 698 start at 611 and ...
4574.  600 Well, while 611, 698 why don't you see 698 Dr. Alfis?
4575.  600 Nu 611, 611, 698 Why don't you see 698 Undine?
4576.  600 Nu 611, currently 611, 698 Why don't you see 698 Papyrus 611, so Undine?
4577.  609 looks like you 698 could have been 698 Better friends ..
4578. Who knows .. 611. Maybe 698 has the key 698 to your happiness ...?
4579.  604 See you soon ..
4580. But after 611, 611, 698, your happy ending didn't reach 698 ..
4581.  605 Why ...?
4582.  604 I know what.
4583.  604 Go to Dr. Alphy.
4584.  605 Your date with you 698 has really only begun 698.
4585. all the way to 698 without killing ...
4586.  So did you go 698605 And then you decided 698 to kill ASGORE?
4587.  606 What the hell is 698 wrong with you?
4588.  604 You missed 698 points totally.
4589.  602 Do you believe me?
4590.  600 due.
4591.  604 no.
4592.  605 You're only 698 to impress you.
4593.  606 Such a waste of everyone's time.
4594.  All you had to do was make friends.
4595. With Papyrus 611, Undine 611, 698 and then Alfis.
4596.  602 but you were 698 busy crashing it!
4597. Hi.
4598. Then you beat me.
4599. I have thought.
4600.  603 Is it really necessary to kill part 698?
4601.  601 I ...
4602.  603 I honestly don't know 698 anymore.
4603.  600 I have a request of 698 for you.
4604.  604 prove to me ...
4605.  605 prove to me that you 698 are strong enough 698 to survive.
4606.  606 Come here from the beginning.
4607.  600 without killing 698 one ...
4608.  604 ... and I don't want to kill the king.
4609.  604 ... and 611, maybe ...
4610.  607 and you have 698 so-called 698 "happy ending."
4611.  606 So 611, what will 698 be?
4612.  605 Want to prove yourself 698?
4613.  Or do I see 698 that you are suffering ...?
4614. At least 611, I'm 698 interested !!!
4615.  604 Hey, hey, hey ...
4616. interesting ...
4617.  606 so 611, even with 698 everything you've done ...
4618.  605 The result is still 698 the same.
4619.  609 By the end of 611, your 698 choices were 698 illusions.
4620.  609 nothing you 698 is very important!
4621.  He is he!
4622.  608 ...
4623.  600 Well.
4624.  606 You did what 698 said to you.
4625.  605 I suppose it's up to 698 for me to get you 698 really happy ending.
4626.  600 For starters, you can't do 698 yourself 698.
4627. Papyrus 611, Undine 611, 698 Alpis .. 611. These guys.
4628.  604 Are you a friend of 698 anyone yet?
4629.  Maybe you should go back 698 and ... 611. "Hang" 698 with them.
4630.  604 Power 698 friendship ...
4631. It always saves 698 day 611, right?
4632.  600 So 611 is really good at killing people 698 ...?
4633.  604 sure.
4634. I'm glad we agree with the 698 standard of living.
4635. I've learned so much from you.
4636.  600. .. 611. Do you want 698 to stop 698 doing things halfway?
4637.  608 Number of people 698 who killed you ...
4638.  609 That's an honest 698 investigation.
4639.  608 you IDIOT.
4640.  604 You really can't do 698 anything right.
4641. Why 611, 620 ...?
4642.  603 Why?
4643.  601 Why?
4644.  608 We were on route 698 for the actual victory ...
4645.  609 Choosing 698 for the last time!
4646.  602 Why do you need 698 bounces?
4647.  605 Hahaha ...
4648.  609 Is that revenue?
4649.  601 let me see you 698 being so clean and 698 happy 611 while I ...?

4652.  607 no.
4653.  608 no.
4654. I know what you're doing.
4655. You just want to see 698 as it is.
4656. Before we investigate it 698 from them.
4657. Ahhaha ...

4666.  You're sad.
4667.  608 Do you really think I want 698 to be 698 friends with you?
4668.  605 Hey ...
4669.  609 You don't really get 698 on 611, right?
4670.  605 There is only one 698 person I can take care of in another 698.
4671.  And even 611, I 698 couldn't care less about 698 about them.
4672.  605 I just think that 698 is someone out there 698 ... The
4673. person I am 698 is not tired of.
4674.  608 One like me.
4675.  608 ...

4679.  so you're here again 698.
4680.  602 What's the matter with you?
4681.  604 Are you trying to start Flowey 698 Fan Club 698?
4682.  605 Because if you want 698 to join ...
4683.  604 you have to 698 talk to Papyrus.
4684.  606 yes 611, he started 698.
4685.  605 some others 698 times 611, anyway.
4686.  600 I'm not lying.
4687.  604 He is one of the 698 better characters to whom 698 applies.
4688.  605 took me a long time in 698 to get bored 698.
4689.  607 ... Yes.
4690.  604 talk to him 698 about him.
4691.  600 so.
4692.  604 Did you start 698 Flowey fan club?
4693.  605 ha 611. 698 I'm just teasing.
4694.  609 I looked at 611. 698 I know you haven't.
4695.  605 But I don't care about 611. 698 really.
4696.  606 He probably would have offered 698 his 698 waste.
4697.  604 you know 611. 698 smiley junk.
4698.  600 ...
4699.  604 Sig.

4707.  604 stay away from 698 those guys.
4708.  600 Why do you keep 698 here again?
4709. You really don't want 698 to be friends 611, 698, would you ...?
4710. ...
4711.  604 no. 611. I will take.
4712. You're like me 611, 698 right?
4713. You don't care about anyone.
4714.  604 You're just bored.
4715. You just want to see what I have to say.
4716.  605 so you can laugh 698 and throw me 698 like a broken toy.
4717.  608 Well, 611, too bad!
4718.  609 I don't like all 698 others.

4734.  601 everything 698 everyone worked so hard for.
4735.  607 ...
4736.  606 Do you know what I'm 698 talking about 611, not 698 you?
4737.  601 That's right.
4738.  604 I'm talking about you.

4743. ... and send back before 698 of all this 698 has happened .
4744.  606 Nobody wants to remember 698 anything.
4745.  605 You can 698 do whatever you want.
4746.  600 ...
4747.  607 that power.
4748.  603 I know that power.
4749.  606 That's the strength of 698 that you fought to keep the 698 611 isn't it?
4750.  607 The power I wanted to use 698.
4751.  606 But now, 611, the idea 698 of restoring 698 everything ...
4752.  607 in ...
4753.  601 I don't think I 698 could do all 698 again.
4754. Not yet.

6829.  600 * but as friends
6830.  603 * ...
6831.  601 * but people 698 do not like 698 politics.
6832.  600 * Because of you 611, not 698, only King 698 has disappeared ...
6833.  603 * but the human souls 698 have disappeared like 698 well ...

6851.  600 * and she became 698 Emperor on the underground 698 ...

6855.  601 * ...
6856.  602 * and hey 611! 698 * It's not so bad!
6857.  600 * She's not alone 698 anymore.

6873.  601 * When the Queen returned to the ruins 698 ...
6874.  602 * I decided to go 698 with her.
6875.  601 * And I also took 698 books from 698 library 611.
6876.  601 * so she couldn't have 698 to read the same 698.
6877.  600 * She's a good roommate 611. 698 * We have a lot of 698 fun.
6878.  601 * ...
6879.  601 * You know.

6882.  601 * Isn't that good?
6883.  603 * ...
6884.  603 * I didn't have the heart 698 to tell you 698 what you did.
6885.  600 * Do you know how she reacted to 698?
6886.  603 * If I had told you 698 because she protected 698 you ...
6887.  604 * ... did you continue to kill my brother ...?
6888.  603 * ...
6889.  601 * Another 611, never entered 698.
6890.  600 * You're not welcome.
6891.  602 * later.
6892. * Since 611 are left, there are 698 items here ...
6893.  603 * different.
6894. * With ASGORE gone ...
6895.  600 * undyne became 698 chief underground 698.
6896.  603 * she decided to 698 destroy all 698 people who come here.
6897.  603 * And when 698 human souls disappear ...
6898.  600 * She also seeks 698 a new way for 698 to break the barrier ...
6899. * And when she will 611, 698 she will hear 698 war against humanity.
6900.  601 * I mean 611, there was also 698 flights of Asgore 611.
6901.  602 * But he's actually 611, 698a611, bad for him.
6902.  600 * Undyne has also expanded Royal Guard 698 massively.
6903. * She says that the first 698 thing she wants to do after 698, we come from here ...
6904. * is to take her army ...
6905.  603 * and personally 698 chase you down and destroy 698 you.
6906.  601 * Meanwhile ...
6907. * I knocked 698 on the door of the 698 rubble ...

7119.  603 * I felt that all I did was 698 ...
7120.  604 * Hope you would annihilate me 611.
7121.  601 * But when Undine called 611, 698 with mad desperation 698 in her voice ...
7122.  600 * i. 611. 698 * I realized I had to do something 698.
7123.  601 * Even if it meant 698, everyone would ...
7124. * have to learn the truth about me.
7125.  602 * It's funny 611. 698 * Do you know?
7126.  605 * Even after all the 698 bad things I have.
7127. I was acting like a hero.
7128.  602 * and they .. 611. 698 * Ask me to run all 698.
7129.  605 * So I'm trying my 698 best 611 here.
7130.  602 * I think I have 698 good policy 611, but 611, 698 Ah, you know ...
7131.  601 * talking to people 698 makes me 698 still nervous.
7132.  600 * I'm not ASGORE 611, 698 Do you know?

10948.  600 * So I'm a protection station in 698 Snodin Forest 611, right?
10949. * I'm sitting there 698 watching people 611. 698 It's kind of boring.
10950.  602 * Luck 611, deep in the 698 forest ...
10951.  600 * It's that big 698 locked door.
10952. * And these are the perfect 698 to four 698 beats.
10953. * One day 611 I hit 698 on those 611, 698 as usual.
10954. * I knock on the 698 door and say 698 "knock."
10955. * And suddenly 611 of the 698 on the other side ...
10956.  601 * I hear a 698 woman voice.
10957.  684 * 600 "Who's there?" 
10958.  629 * 601 SEG 611, of course 611, in 698 answer:
10959.  600 * "Dishes."
10960.  684 * "Which cook?"
10961.  629 * 602 "Solves 698 bad jokes."
10962.  600 * She just cried with laughter.
10963.  601 * Like this is the best 698 joke she's heard in 698 for a hundred years.
10964.  600 * I always get 611 and she keeps laughing.
10965.  601 * She's the best 698 viewers I've ever had.
10966.  600 * Then 611, after their 698 dozen 611, 698 she knocks and says ...
10967.  684 * "Knock hit!"
10968.  629 * 601 I say "What's 698 there?"
10969.  684 * 600 "Old lady!"
10970.  629 * 601 "Old woman, eh?"
10971.  684 * 602 "Oh! I don't know you could 698 a cutter!"
10972.  629 * 601 Wow.
10973.  Of course 611, 698, the woman was 698 extremely good.
10974.  600 * We keep 698 jokes every other 698 hours together.
10975.  600 * Finally 611 I had 698 to go.
10976.  602 * Papyrus gets type 698 from crank without 698 available.
10977.  600 * but she told me that 698 would come back 611, 698 and so on.
10978.  600 * I return 611. 698 * and again 611. 698 * There is now one.
10979. * Say bad jokes 698 out the door.
10980.  601 * It controls.
10981. * ...
10982.  600 * a day 611, although I 611, I noticed 698 because she didn't laugh 698 that much.
10983. * I asked her what 698 were up there.
10984. * She told me something funny.
10985. "If you come through the 698 door ..."
10986. * "Can you please 611, 698, legal 698 something?"
10987. * "Watch them 611, 698 and protect them 611, 698 don't you want?"
10988.  600 * 629 Now 611, I hate giving 698 promises.
10989.  601 * And the woman 611, 698 I don't even know her 698 name.
10990.  603 * but ...
10991.  601 * the one who sincerely 698 likes bad jokes ...
10992.  602 * has integrity 698 you can't say 698 "no" to.
10993.  601 * Do you get what 698 say?
10994.  The 600 * promise I gave her 698 ...
10995.  601 * Do you know what would have happened 698 if she 698 hadn't said anything?
10996.  603 * ... mate.
10997. You were dead where you stand.
10998.  603 * ...
10999.  601 * Hi 611, List 611, 698 Again!
11000.  602 * I'm just kidding you 698.
11001.  601 * Unless ...
11002.  600 * I haven't done a good job protecting 698 you?
11003. * I mean 611, look at 698.
11004.  602 * You're not dead 698 even.
11005.  600 * That's right 611, isn't it 698?
11006.  602 * well 611, chalk it up to 698 to my great 698 skills.
11007.  600 * hi 611, what does 698 look like for 698 devices?
11008.  601 * Am I wrong ...?
11009. * heh.
11010. * Well 611, that's all.
11011.  601 * Take care of 698 even 611 children.
11012.  600 * because someone is really interested in you.
11013. * (The door is locked.)
11014. * (You open the door and 698 enters ...)
11015. * (There is a mailbox overlying 698 with unread junk mail.)
11016. * (There is a snowball with the 698 word "Sense". Written on it 698 with the red mark.)
11017. * It looks like 698 are in circles exactly 698 to sound ...
11018.  661 * 621 left.
11019.  661 * The comic ...
11020. * Decision.
11021. * The comics published 611. 698 * Error.
11022.  661 * 621 remaining.
11023. * Decision.
11024.  661 * 621 remaining.
11025. * Decision.

11074.  605 Thank you for your 698 purchase. *
11075.  600 only 698 out? *
11076.  606 There is not enough 698 money. *
11077.  606 You are 698 with 698 too much. *
11078. *
11079.  600 Care of chatting 698? *
11080.  603 * HA 611? 698 * Sell something 611? 698 * Does it look like a 698 pawn shop?
11081.  604 * I don't know how this works, where does 698 come from ... but ...
11082.  600 * If I started spending money 698 on old branches and using 698 bandages 611, then I would be in business 698 in a jiffy!
11083.  604 * If you really wound up 698 money 611, you could 698 make a crash.
11084. * I hear people are paying for 698 something today.
11085. * You caught 758g behind the 698 disk.
11086. * Nothing left.
11087.  600 * now now 611! 698 * Come on!
11088. * ...
11089.  600 * Hiya 611! Welcome to Snowdin 611! 698 * I don't remember the last 698 times, I've seen a healthy face around 698 here.
11090.  604 * Where did you come from 611? 698 * The capital?
11091.  600 * You don't look like a tourist. 611. 698 * Are you here yourself?
11092.  600 * I mean 611, it came to you 611, 698 Did you know?
11093. * It was a strange flash of 698 white light .. 611. 698 * So I felt my body pull 698 in ... 611. something.
11094. * Since 611, suddenly 611, all 698 have returned to normal.
11095.  600 * Want to know what to do 698 here in Snowdin?
11096.  604 * Grillby's gets dinner 611 and the 698 library has information ...
11097. * If you're tired of the 611, you can sneak into Inn 611. 698 * That's right at 611 - my sister 698 runs it.
11098.  600 * And if you board the 611, you can sit 698 outside and watch the crazy 698 skeletons do their thing.
11099.  600 * There are two of them. 611. 698 * 604 brothers 611, I think 611. 698 * They only came one day 698 and .. 611. 698 * 600 ... confirm themselves.
11100. * The city has become much more interesting since then.
11101.  I heard all this because 698 people came here.
11102. * Man .. 611. 698 * I can hardly believe it!
11103. * Well, if they decide to keep 698 in 611, I'll be sure to welcome 698 perfectly.
11104.  604 * Think back to your 698 class history ...
11105.  600 * A long time ago 611 monsters lived 698 in RUINS III in the 698 forest.
11106. * Long story 611, we all decided 698 to leave the ruins and aim 698 at the end of the caves.
11107. * Together with 611, some fat people 698 decided they liked the cold 698 and set up camp in Snowdin.
11108.  606 * Really 611, and don't forget that 698 is trying to explore RUINS ...
11109.  600 * The door is locked 698 times 611. 698 * So if you are not a ghost 698 or can dig under the door 611, 698 forget it.
11110.  600 * Did Deja hear 611? 698 * Ruins have already opened 611, 698 and get this ...
11111. * They were opened from 698 inside.
11112. The queen seems to have been 698 and stayed there, because god 698 knows how long.
11113. * Rather incredible 611, eh !?
11114.  600 * life is the same as usual.
11115.  601 * A little sense of containment ...
11116.  602 * But .. 611. We all know inside 698 that freedom comes 611, right?
11117.  602 * As long as we hope for 611, we can 698 cut our teeth and face the same 698 battle 611, day after day ...
11118.  605 * That's life 611, isn't it?
11119.  600 * Well 611, I think I want to send my 698 store to the world ...
11120. * ... I haven't planned much 698 more than 611, I'm afraid.
11121. * (There is a tone here.)
11122. * Please don't hurt my family.
11123. * Don't be shy now. *
11124. * WHA 611! 698 * I have beautiful 698 trash for sale. *
11125. * Wah ha ha 611! 698 * I knew you could 698 do this! ^^
11126. Wa ha ha .. 611. 698 * So you came here 611. 698 * What a treat! *
11127. What is 698 looking for 698 for? *
11128. Thank you! 698 Hi hv. *
11129. Carefully 698 with him. *
11130. You are 698 little 698 short 698 money. *
11131. You are 698 dressed 698 too much! *
11132. Don't expect 698 discounts. *
11133. Here we are 698. *
11134. ... *
11135. HA 611? 698 You can't afford 698 with 698 it? *
11136. Don't have 698 enough 698? *
11137. Something 698 you 698 want 698 know? *
11138. Really? 698 You 698 Want 698 conversations? *
11139.  602 * HA 611! 600 698 * I'm trying to get Reed in my 698 trash 611, don't get any more of it!
11140.  604 * Although 611 I've heard if you want 698 to sell 611 stuff, but Tammie 698 Village is your best thing.
11141.  600 * Where is it?
11142.  603 * ...
11143.  600 * I don't remember.
11144. * Last time in 611 I didn't take 698!
11145. * I hear people are paying for 698 something today.
11146.  603 * I wouldn't buy your cheesy 698 trash at the knife point.
11147. * Be careful there 611, kid!
11148. * Good redness.
11149. * I've been long 611. 698 * 603 Maybe too long.
11150.  602 * Learning history is definitely 698 easy when you have made 698 so much of it yourself 611! 698 * 600 Whoa ha ha!
11151.  600 * A long time ago, 611, ASGORE and I 698 agreed that fleeing 698 was meaningless ...
11152.  603 * Since we left from 611, 698 would kill us.
11153.  601 * I felt a little cheated when he finally changed his mind.
11154.  604 * Now I think 611. 611. 698 * Maybe he was right.
11155.  602 * Because after 611, though 698 we can't escape ...
11156.  603 * Still killing us 611, 698 isn't that right?
11157. * Good 611, good 611! 698 * I remember it clearly now.
11158.  603 * This was Castle 611's monthly address and Queen 698 participated in 698 current events.
11159.  600 * After completing the 611, 698 update, she moved to send the 698 microphone to the King.
11160.  603 * But 611 did not know that the 698 microphone was still in her hands when she said:
11161.  602 * "Light up 611, fluffy bubbles."
11162.  600 * The audience bursts into laughter.
11163.  602 * understands what she said 611, 698, and she also began to laugh.
11164.  600 * After some time 611, the king lifted 698 arms 611. 698 * The audience was silent.
11165.  603 * He leaned toward the 698 microphone 611, the phrase .. 611. 698 * Stern.
11166.  600 * "Dear Citizen. 611" 698 * "Thank you for bringing 698 here today."
11167.  603 * "I .. 611. King of the Fluffyuns ..."
11168.  602 * And the rest is history.
11169.  602 * What is it for 611? 698 * Do you want me to repeat myself?
11170.  600 * Heck no. 611! 698 * Your eyes are still working .. 611. 698 * Go read a book or something else 611! 698 * Wahaha!
11171.  600 * Oh yes .. 611. 698 * Prophetic.
11172.  604 * The story has it, an "angel" who saw the surface will fall 698 from the top and bring us freedom.
11173.  603 * Recently, 611 inhabitants became 698 and became more visible ...
11174.  604 * Callin 'who winged the cross of the 698' angel of death. "
11175.  603 * Destruction of Destruction 611, 698 Waiting to 'Save' us from 698 This Mortal World ...
11176. * In My Mind 611 When I See the 698 The Little Cross ...
11177.  602 * I think it looks pretty 611! 698 * Wahaha!
11178.  600 * Signs are actually ahead of 698 written history 611. 698 * The original meaning is lost 698 over time ...
11179.  604 * All we know is that the 698 triangles represent us monsters 698 under 611 and the winged circle 698 above represents. ..
11180.  603 * different ..
11181.  600 * Most people say that he is 698 'the angel 611', from the prophecy ...
11182.  600 * ha 611? 698 * Don't know what it is?
11183.  601 * What do they teach 698 guys at school today. .. 611? 698 * 602 Whoa ha ha!
11184.  660 * 600 It's 663 Delta Run 611, 660 698 Emblem of Our Kingdom 611. 698 * Kingdom ...
11185. * ... of monsters.
11186. * Wahaha 611! 698 * Good name 611, hi 611? 698 * I always say it ...
11187. why* ol 'King FluffyBuns can not name for 698 beans!
11188.  * 603 EH 611? 698 * F s?
11189.  602 * 611 In fact, it reminds me of 611. 698 * Toriel once owned a flower - 698 pa tterned MV-mu ... 
11190.  600 * People were told to say "nice mu-mu 698" with her 611, but it continued to 698 Thought they called you a cow.
11191.  So she never wore it again.
11192.  603 * What is the question again?
11193.  600 * actually 611. 698 * right 611. 698 * ASGORE.
11194.  603 * He is really interesting 698 type of monster 611. 698 * The strongest type of all.
11195.  600 * We call them boss monsters.
11196. * When they sow 611, 698, 698 parents SOUL power runs into the 698 child ...
11197. * Allows the child to grow to 698 as parents grow older.
11198.  603 * But ASGORE does not have a 698 child 611. 698 * so he is stuck at age 698 .. 611. 698 * and will probably last forever.
11199.  601 * of 611? 698 * What if the child is 698 person ... 611? What?
11200.  601 * Nah 611. It wouldn't work 611. 698 * So if ASGORE is your parent 611, 698, he will surely survive 698 of you.
11201.  601 * I've lived too long in 698 to be afraid of something 698 like you.
11202.  602 * Try it 611, good!
11203.  603 * ... I know you can't here.
11204.  601 * Wa ha .. 611. 698 * I know how it is 698, the only reason I lived 698 for so long.
11205. * King of Floppionbones 611? 698 * He's a friendly 611, a happy happy 698 a guy ...
11206.  604 * If you continue with probably 698 611, you'll probably meet him 611. 698 * 600 He loves to walk around and 698 talk to people.
11207.  603 * EH 611? 698 * Why do I call Dreemurr 698 'Fluffyuns? 611 '698 * 602 Oh 611, that's a great story!
11208.  603 * ...
11209.  600 * I don't remember.
11210. * If you come back 698 later 611, then I'm sure I remember 698.
11211.  602 * Oh yeah 611! 698 * Of course 611. 698 * Toriel is Queen 611 and 698 Asgore is King.
11212.  603 * It was sad when she left.
11213.  601 * Because everyone knew she was 698 really the brain behind the 698 throne ...

11500.  603 * You can somehow understand comedy 698 but people like the guy that 698 goes on stage and 698 cries about his family.

11510.  605 * ... brought my pants 698.
11511.  604 * and the girls laughed at me.
11512.  604 * Everyone calls me now Burger Pants 698.
11513. 
11514.  606 * Listen 611. 698 * I like you 611, little friend 611. 698 * So I save you a lot of 698 problems.

11516.  606 * If you are not "one of those 611", 698, they will only remove 698 benefits from you.
11517.  603 * At that moment, the two 698 chicks asked me to sneak into their 698 some glamor.
11518.  606 * And I 611, a childless teenager, to 698. I was 611, said yes to them.
11519.  604 * Bad idea.
11520.  604 * The girls? 698 * Those who have seen my pants 698 fall down?
11521.  605 * Well 611, we'll all be 698 free 611, so I'll never see 698 then again 611, at least!
11522.  604 * Now we welcome.

11525.  605 * I know 611, it's not really 698a .. 611. 698 * Date.
11526.  606 * Here's trick 611, little friend 611: 698 * lying to yourself all the time 611. 698 * You feel better.
11527.  604 * Well 611, Mettaton didn't tell me 698 I have to work, I think ...
11528.  603 * but this is stuff 611! 698 * Sometimes he can't even call me 698 at work until 698 half of my watch!
11529.  604 * If I can't play safe 611, 698 then he'll scream at me.
11530.  606 * Okay 611, maybe "screaming" is 698 the wrong word.
11531.  604 * That's more than he did it .. 611. 698 * CD, he's playing ...
11532.  605 * It's totally packed with 698 songs about how bad I am at 698 in my job.
11533.  605 * Let's not talk about this.
11534.  601 * Why do people think he's so 698 attractive?
11535.  He is literally ugly rectangle 698.

11541.  603 * God 611, have you ever seen 698 about 611? 698 * This place is a maze of 698 bad choices.
11542. * And every time we try to turn 698 into something better 611, it knows 698 and says "It's not 698 how they do it on the 698 surface."
11543.  601 Oh! Okay!
11544.  603 * People always eat 698 burgers of 698 and blue sequins.
11545.  605 * When I came to Hotland 611, 698, it was my dream to work 698 with Mettaton.
11546.  604 * ...
11547.  603 * Well 611, be careful what you want 698 611, little friend!
11548.  603 * Don't tell anyone this 611, little 698 mate.
11549.  604 * (because they want to deceive 698 of me,)
11550.  605 * But I .. 611. 698 * I think I play a hand in 698, everyone gets some free 698.
11551.  601 * Even though there were only 698 who did An awful job ...
11552.  605 * I think I did something!
11553.  603 * I don't know if this is true 611, 698, but I still do!
11554.  603 * Hey? 698 * Anyone else dead?
11555.  604 * ...
11556.  605 * Does that mean I don't have to work 698 today?
11557.  606 * God 611. 698 * That it was true 611, 698 Few strange 611. 698 * That it was true.
11558.  603 * Future 611? 698 * What future 611? 698 * Nothing below ALT 698 changes.
11559.  604 * I probably caught 698 in this stupid job forever.

12186. The day after. *

12188. ... *
12189. A man died.
12190. ASRIEL 611, packed 698 with sorrow 611, 698, 698 absorbed human sole. *
12191. He transformed 698 into being 698 with incredible 698 power.
12192. With man 698 SOUL 611, Asriel 698 went through the 698 barrier. *
12193. He brought the body of 698 people 698 into the sunset. *
12194. Back to 698 village 698 people.
12195. ASRIEL reached 698 in the center of the 698 village. *
12196. There, 611 he found 698 beds with 698 golden flowers. *
12197. He carried 698 people 698 IT.
12198. Suddenly, 611 cried and screamed 698. *
12199. Villagers 698 saw ASRIEL 698 holding the 698 human body. *
12200. They thought 698 that he had killed the 698 child.

12209. He went into the lock 698 and 698 collapsed. *
12210. His dust spread 698 across the yard 698.
12211. The state fell 698 in despair. The
12212. King and Queen 698 lost 698 two children overnight. 698.
12213. Again, the inhabitants of 698 took us from 698 to a total of 698.
12214. The king decided that 698 was a time of 698 to end our 698 suffering. *
12215. Every person who falls 698 to 698 must die. *
12216. With enough souls 611, 698 we can blast the 698 barrier 698 forever.

12218. King ASGORE 698 lets 698. *
12219. King ASGORE 698 gives us 698 jumps. *
12220. King ASGORE 698 saves us all 698. 
12221. You must also be 698 smiling 611. *
12222. Isn't 698 you 698 excited? *
12223. Isn't 698 you 698 happy?
12224. You want to be free.
12225.  600 Hodi 611, 620!
12226. You have finally created 698 homes.
12227.  600 Do you remember when we played 698 here?
12228.  600 He he he he ...
12229. boy!
12230.  609 698 today is just as quiet.
12231.  601 I remember when I woke up 698 here 611, 698 in the yard.
12232. I was scared.
12233.  602 I couldn't feel my 698 arms or my feet ...
12234.  601 my whole body turned 698 into 698 flowers!
12235.  "Mother 611! Father 611! 698 Someone helps me 611!" 698 I called.
12236.  But no one came.
12237.  601 Finally 611 King 698 found me 611 and cried in the yard 698.
12238. I explained what had happened to him 698.
12239. Then he gave me 611, 698 620.
12240. He gave me 698 tears in his eyes 611, 698 and said. .
12241. "It's 611, where 611. 698 everything will be fine."
12242. He was like that. 611. 698 emotionally.
12243.  601 But .. 611. 698 For some reason ...
12244.  601 I don't know 698 anything.
12245.  601 I quickly realized that I knew nothing about anyone.
12246. My mercy is gone!
12247.  607 And believe me 611, 698 It's not like 698 that I didn't try.
12248.  603 I spent weeks with 698 stupid King 611, 698 in vain hoping I would 698 feel something.
12249.  But it became too much for me.
12250. I ran from 698 homes.
12251. Eventually 611 I managed to reach 698 ruins.
12252.  600 in. I found here 611, 698 620.
12253. I thought of all 698 people 611, she could 698 make me feel all 698.
12254.  601 ...
12255.  607 She failed.
12256.  606 Ha ha ...
12257.  601 I realized that 698 two were insignificant.
12258. I was in despair.
12259. I just wish 698 would love anyone.
12260. I just wish 698 didn't care about anyone.
12261.  620 611, you 698 couldn't believe this ...
12262.  602 but I decided ... 611. 698 It's not 698 worth living anymore.
12263.  607 Not in a world 698 Without love.
12264.  606 not in a world of 698 without you.
12265.  601 So ...
12266.  600 I decided to follow 698 in your footsteps.
12267.  601 I wanted to avoid the existence of 698.
12268.  601 And do you know what?
12269.  600 managed me.
12270.  But when I left the coil of death 698 ...
12271. I started to feel 698 worries.
12272.  609 If you don't have 698 a SOUL 611, what happens to 698 when you ...?
12273.  601 something first and foremost 698 started to burn 698 inside me.
12274. "No, 611," I thought, 611. 698 "I don't want 698 to die!"
12275. ...
12276. Then I woke up.
12277. 698 Like just a bad dream.
12278. I was back in the yard 698.
12279.  600 back in 698 “my savings point.”
12280. Interested in 611, I decided to try 698.
12281. Again and again 611 I led 698 to death.
12282. When it's 611, I could have 698 let the world 698 continue on 698 without me.
12283. But as long as I was 698 for 698 lives ...
12284.  600 I could go back.
12285.  606 Big 611, isn't it 611, 698 620?
12286.  600s of surprises.
12287.  611 came to me601 first 611 I used my 698 powers for good.
12288.  600 I became "friends" 698 with everyone.
12289. I solved all of their 698 problems flawlessly.
12290. Their 698 friendship was fun ...
12291.  601 for a while. 
12292.  601 When repeated 611, 698 people themselves were 698 themselves 698 foreseeable.
12293. What would the 698 person say if I gave them this?
12294. What would they do 698 if I said this to 698 then?
12295. When you know that the 698 answer is 611.
12296. That's all they are.
12297.  601 It all started 698 because I was 698 curious.
12298.  600 curious what would happen to 698 if I killed 698 then.
12299.  "I don't like those 611s," 698 I said to myself.
12300.  601 “I only do this to 698 because I have 698 to know what's going on.
12301.  608 ha ha ha .. 611. 698 What an excuse!
12302.  609 You all 698 must know how free 698 it is for 698 to deal with this way.
12303.  608 We are at least 698 better than the diseases 698 that stand around and 698 see it ...
12304.  609 Sad people 698 who want to see it 611, 698 but are too weak for the 698 to do it themselves.
12305.  600 I'm sure someone 698 is looking for the real 698 now 611, aren't they ...?
12306.  601 Today 611, there are 698 immediately.
12307.  607 You understand 611, 698 620.
12308.  606 I've done everything 698 the world has 698 to offer.
12309.  601 I've read every book 611. 698 I've burned all 698 books.
12310. I've won every game 611. 698 I've lost every game.
12311. I've brought in 698 all 611. 698 I've killed everyone.
12312. Number of figures. 611. 698 conversations. 61. 698 I've seen them all.
12313.  601 But you .. 611. 698 You are different.
12314.  600 I could never predict 698 611, 620.
12315.  601 When I saw you in 698 RUINS 611, I couldn't recognize 698 you.
12316.  608 I thought I could 698 scare you 611, so 698 steal your soul.
12317.  601 I failed.
12318.  600 And when I tried 698 to save my 698 file savings ...
12319.  601 it didn't work.
12320.  609 620 .. 611. 698 Your decision!
12321.  608 somehow 611, it's even 698 bigger than mine!
12322.  601 I only have one question on 698 for you 611, 698 620.
12323. How did 698 get back to RUINS 698 from here ...?
12324.  600 ... wait 611, I know.
12325. She must take you 698 when she leaves.
12326.  601 and decided to give 698 proper burial 611, 698 rather than ...
12327.  600 hanging in the basement 698 forever.
12328.  601 ... but 611, why so ...?
12329. What woke you up?
12330.  606 Did you hear me call you 698 ...?
12331.  601 It doesn't matter 698 now.
12332.  601 I'm so tired of 698 611, 620.
12333. I'm tired of all the people.
12334. I'm tired of all 698 places.
12335. I'm tired of being 698 flowers.
12336.  620.
12337.  600 There is only one 698 I want to do 698.
12338. Let's finish what we started in 698.
12339. Let's all cheer.
12340.  608 So .. 611. Let's 698 They see how 698 humanity is 698 Oh!

12343.  601 So ...?
12344.  607 Well 611. 698 I had ...

12347.  601 ...
12348.  601 but you see her here 698 changed me.
12349.  606 620 .. 611. 698 I think if you are 698 ...
12350.  607 living only in 698 surface world 698 might not seem so bad.
12351.  600 We don't even have to allow 698 to get 698 then this time.
12352. The king locked up six of his 698.
12353.  601 I've tried hundreds of 698 ways to get him 698 to show me them ...
12354.  603 but he just couldn't come.
12355.  601 620 ...
12356.  600 I know he does 698 to you.
12357.  600 Why do I say all 698?
12358.  606 620 611, I said it 698 before.
12359.  601 Even after all this 698 times ...
12360.  600 You are still the only 698 that 698 understands me.
12361.  608 You will not give me 698 any wrong sins!
12362.  609 Creatures We ...
12363.  600 wouldn't hesitate to 698 do something if the 698 we entered is 698 on behalf of others.

12647. * Ironically 611 , talking does not 698   seem to be the solution 698   to this situation.
12648. * You thought about telling 698   Toriel that you saw 698   her die.
12649. * But... 698 * That's creepy.
12650. * Can you show mercy without 698   fighting or running 698   away...?

12700. * You can pick them up 611 , 698   but do not carry more 698   than you need.
12701. * Someday you might see 698   something you really 698   like.

12740. * Prove to me you 698   are strong enough 698   to survive!

12742. * ... why are you looking 698   at me like that?

12747.  601 * Hey 611 , let me finish
12748. * Already?
12749. * What will it take 698   for you to learn 698   your lesson?
12750. * How did you get 698   here 611 , my child 611 ? 698 * Are you hurt?
12751. * Not a scratch.. 611 . 698 * 600  Impressive 611 ! 698 * 601  But still...

12754.  601 * I should not have 698   left you alone 698   for so long.
12755. * It was irresponsible 698   to try to surprise 698   you like this.
12756.  608 * Err...
12757.  600 * Well 611 , I suppose I 698   cannot hide it 698   any longer.
12758. * Come 611 , small one!
12759. * Oh dear 611 , that took 698   longer than I 698   thought it would.
12760. * Do you smell that 611 ?
12761. * Surprise!
12762. * It is a butterscotch- 698   cinnamon pie.
12763. * I thought we might 698   celebrate your 698   arrival.
12764. * I want you to have 698   a nice time living 698   here.
12765. * So I will hold off 698   on snail pie for 698   tonight.
12766. * Here 611 , I have another 698   surprise for you.
12767. * Do you smell that 611 ?
12768.  601 * Er 611 , I assume that 698   expression means you 698   do.
12769.  600 * S.. 611 . surprise!
12770. * I have baked a snail 698   pie.
12771. * I thought we might 698   celebrate your 698   arrival.
12772. * I want you to have 698   a nice time living 698   here.
12773.  601 * So I...
12774.  600 * Here 611 , I have another 698   surprise for you.
12775. * This is it...
12776. * Is something burning...? 698 * Um 611 , make yourself 698   at home!
12777. * A room of your own. 698 * I hope you like it!
12778. * I think you should 698   play upstairs 698   instead.
12779. * It is dangerous 698   to play here.
12780. * It is drafty here. 698 * You will catch 698   a cold.
12781. * It is dusty here. 698 * You will catch 698   a cough.
12782. * There is nothing 698   to see here.
12783. * Do you want to 698   read a book?
12784.  607 * I do not like 698   the game you 698   are playing.
12785.  600 * Why not go for 698   a walk in the 698   yard?
12786. * Really now.
12787.  604 * ...
12788. * Hey 611 , do not go down 698   here.
12789. * I have something 698   to show you 698   upstairs.
12790. * You wish to know how 698   to return "home," 698   do you not?
12791. * Ahead of us lies the 698   end of the RUINS.
12792. * A one-way exit to the 698   rest of the underground.
12793. * I am going to destroy 698   it.
12794. * No one will ever 698   be able to leave 698   again.
12795. * Now be a good child 698   and go upstairs.
12796. * Do not worry about 698   me.
12797. * Someone has to take 698   care of these flowers.
12798. * Don't worry about 698   me.
12799. * Someone has to take 698   care of these flowers.
12800. * Frisk 611 , please leave 698   me alone.
12801.  603 * I can't come back 611 . 698 * I just can't 611 , OK?
12802.  607 * I don't want to break 698   their hearts all over 698   again.
12803. * It's better if they 698   never see me.
12804.  607 * ... why are you still 698   here?
12805. * Are you trying to keep 698   me company?
12806.  600 * Frisk...
12807. * ...
12808.  607 * Hey.
12809.  600 * Let me ask you a 698   question.
12810. * Frisk.. 611 . 698 * Why did you come 698   here?
12811. * Everyone knows the 698   legend 611 , right...?
12812. * "Travellers who climb 698   Mt. Ebott are said 698   to disappear."
12813.  607 * ...
12814. * Frisk.
12815. * 600  Why would you ever 698   climb a mountain 698   like that?
12816.  607 * Was it foolishness?
12817.  600 * Was it fate?
12818.  601 * Or was it.. 611 . 698 * Because you...?
12819.  607 * Well.
12820.  600 * Only you know the 698   answer 611 , don't you...?
12821.  602 * I know why  620  698   climbed the mountain.
12822.  607 * It wasn't for a 698   very happy reason.
12823.  602 * Frisk 611 . 698 * I'll be honest with 698   you.
12824.  607 *  620  hated humanity.
12825.  602 * Why they did 611 , they 698   never talked about 698   it.
12826.  601 * But they felt very 698   strongly about 698   that.
12827.  602 * Frisk.. 611 . 698 * You really ARE different 698   from  620 .
12828.  600 * In fact 611 , though you 698   have similar 611 , uh 611 , 698   fashion choices...
12829. * I don't know why I 698   ever acted like you 698   were the same person.
12830.  607 * Maybe.. 611 . 698 * The truth is...
12831.  601 *  620  wasn't really 698   the greatest person.
12832.  607 * While 611 , Frisk...
12833.  600 * You're the type of 698   friend I wish I 698   always had.
12834.  607 * So maybe I was kind 698   of projecting a 698   little bit.
12835.  600 * Let's be honest 611 . 698 * I did some weird 698   stuff as a flower.
12836.  602 * There's one last 698   thing I feel like 698   I should tell you.
12837. * Frisk 611 , when  620  698   and I combined our 698   SOULs together...
12838. * The control over our 698   body was actually split 698   between us.
12839. * They were the one 698   that picked up their 698   own empty body.
12840. * And then 611 , when we 698   got to the village...
12841.  602 * They were the one 698   that wanted to...
12842.  601 * ... to use our full 698   power.
12843.  602 * I was the one that 698   resisted.
12844.  607 * And then 611 , because of 698   me 611 , we...
12845.  601 * Well 611 , that's why I 698   ended up a flower.
12846.  602 * Frisk...
12847. * This whole time 611 , I've 698   blamed myself for 698   that decision.
12848. * That's why I adopted 698   that horrible view 698   of the world.
12849. * "Kill or be killed."
12850.  607 * But now.. 611 . 698 * After meeting you...
12851.  600 * Frisk 611 , I don't regret 698   that decision anymore.
12852.  604 * I did the right 698   thing.
12853. * If I killed those 698   humans...
12854. * We would have had to 698   wage war against all 698   of humanity.
12855.  600 * And in the end 611 , 698   everyone went free 611 , 698   right?
12856.  607 * I still feel kind 698   of sad knowing how 698   long it took...
12857.  600 * ... so maybe it 698   wasn't a perfect 698   decision.
12858. * But you can't regret 698   hard choices your 698   whole life 611 , right?
12859.  607 * Well 611 , not that I 698   have much of a life 698   left.
12860.  600 * But that's besides 698   the point.
12861. * Frisk 611 , thank you 698   for listening to me.
12862. * You should really go 698   be with your friends 698   now 611 , OK?
12863. * Oh 611 , and 611 , please...
12864.  607 * In the future 611 , if you 698   uh 611 , see me...
12865. * Don't think of it as 698   me 611 , OK?
12866.  600 * I just want you to 698   remember me like this.
12867.  600 * Someone that was your 698   friend for a little 698   while.
12868.  602 * Oh 611 , and Frisk...
12869.  600 * Be careful in the 698   outside world 611 , OK?
12870. * Despite what everyone 698   thinks 611 , it's not as 698   nice as it is here.
12871.  607 * There are a lot of 698   Floweys out there.
12872.  602 * And not everything can 698   be resolved by just 698   being nice.
12873.  600 * Frisk...
12874. * Don't kill 611 , and 698   don't be killed 611 , 698   alright?
12875. * That's the best you 698   can strive for.
12876. * Well 611 , see you.
12877.  607 * Frisk...
12878.  606 * Don't you have 698   anything better to 698   do?

12896. * But if there's ever a problem 611 , 698   a skeleton will tell a fish 698   lady about it.
12897. * Thaaaaaat's politics!
12898. * Politics.
12899. * What if I ran for mayor...?
12900. * I don't think I would do 698   a good job 611 , and I hate 698   responsibility...
12901. * But I love politics 611 . 698 * So I might be a perfect 698   match.
12902. * I heard Dr. Alphys told 698   the king and queen the 698   awful things she'd done.
12903. * The king felt so bad 698   that he didn't know 611 . 698 * He gave her a big hug.
12904. * Then the queen fired her.
12905. * Now we don't have a Royal 698   Scientist anymore...
12906. * Thaaaaat's politics!
12907. * Too bad there are no 698   politics on the surface.
12908. * Hmmm 611 , usually that skeleton 698   goes to meet with Undyne 698   about now.
12909. * Where is he... 611 ? 698 * I can feel our political 698   system crumbling apart...
12910. * Awful teens tormented 698   a local monster by decorating 698   its tree-like horns.
12911. * So we started giving that 698   monster presents to make it 698   feel better.
12912. * Now it's a tradition to put 698   presents underneath a decorated 698   tree.
12913. * Guess it was a good thing 698   those teens tormented that 698   monster...?
12914. * Hmm 611 ? 698 * Adjusting the presents is 698   my responsibility.
12915. * Nah 611 , to be honest 611 , I 698   just keep looking to see 698   if I've gotten one...
12916. * It'll be nice to show humans 698   our presents-under-the-tree 698   tradition.
12917. * They'll probably be weirded 698   out by it.
12918. * You know what's cute?
12919. * Those two married dogs 698   always put presents under 698   the tree for each other.
12920. * It's always the same 611 . 698 * A single bone.
12921. * But every time 611 , they act 698   like it's the first time 698   they've gotten it.
12922. * Then Papyrus comes to take 698   his bones back.
12923. * Anyway 611 , where are those 698   two...?
12924. * That's strange 611 . 698 * There was a present here 698   for Papyrus...

12926. * That lady over there...
12927. * Something about her disturbs 698   me.
12928. * I think I've figured it out 611 . 698 * ... no 611 , nevermind.
12929. * That lady over there's 698   been going for a walk 698   for a while now.
12930. * ... but she hasn't moved 698   an inch from where she's 698   standing.
12931. * W-well 611 , I haven't either 611 , 698   but I don't want her to 698   notice me over here...
12932. * Uhhh...
12933. * Is anyone else weirded out 698   by those giant shambling 698   amalgamates 611 , or...?
12934. * ......
12935. * That lady over there 698   seems happy today.
12936. * Don't know why 611 , but it's 698   sending shivers down my 698   spine...
12937. * Isn't my little Cinnamon 698   just the cutest?
12938. * Bun-buns are so adorable.. 611 . 698 * Tee hee!
12939. * Bun-bun-bun-bun-bun...
12940. * Huh 611 ? Yes 611 , I'm taking 698   my bunny for a walk.
12941. * It's just a very slow one.
12942. * That kid over there told 698   me that it's weird that 698   I have a pet bunny.
12943. * First 611 , there'd be nothing 698   weird about it 611 . 698 * It's cute!
12944. * Second.. 611 . 698 * What?
12945. * It's normal to walk your 698   younger brother on a 698   leash 611 , right?
12946. * Ah 611 , it's so peaceful 698   and quiet...
12947. * Usually one of those dogs 698   chases my little Cinnamon 698   around.
12948. * Ah 611 , it's so peaceful 698   and quiet...
12949. * Usually one of those 698   skeletons chases my little 698   Cinnamon around.
12950. * The capital's getting pretty 698   crowded 611 , so I've heard they're 698   going to start moving here.
12951. * Hmmm.. 611 . 698 * I don't want to see the 698   erasure of our local culture.
12952. * But I definitely want to see 698   some city slickers slip onto 698   their butts!
12953. * Yeah 611 , bring 'em on!
12954. * What will happen to 698   Grillby's if everyone 698   moves in...?
12955. * We're gonna have to have 698   chairs to the ceiling.
12956. * Hey 611 ! People won't have to 698   move in from the city 698   anymore!
12957. * Seems like we won't have 698   to lose our local culture.
12958. * ... except we're all moving 698   out of here 611 , huh.
12959. * Oh well 611 . Guess it can't be 698   all punk-peaches and punk- 698   cream.
12960. * The capital's getting pretty 698   crowded 611 , so I've heard they're 698   going to start moving here.
12961. * ... who knows 611 . 698 * Maybe we'll have room.
